Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn''t really tell who''s was who''s and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn''t go back."

Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant."

SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,2404,4zopEEPqfwm-c_FNpeHZYw,5,"We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you''re going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed."

My husband and I had a wonderful time.  Jen, our tour guide, was helpful and informative.  We had a lot of fun exploring the caves.

The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.

Came for some live music with friends on Saturday. Very cool. Best local beer in town by far. Seems like the concept is a few notches up from Fig Mountain. Definitely prefer Topa. Even cooler is that you can order incredible food from the Nook Restaurant, and walk two feet into Lama Dog which is part of the Waterline. I love it!!"

Our favorite thus far has been the Backyard Bowl, although there are several more that we still need to try. My husband and I are always full after we each get a kids size, or split a large. The ingredients are good quality,  filling foods. For the quality of ingredients, the price is very reasonable. It can get pretty busy here, but have patience, it is worth the wait."

eL4lyE7LNoXEMvpcJ8WNVw,Deep Sea Tasting Room,217 G Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,472,dpgq69tsI2f_GpRH71hQsA,3,"This was a tough one!   On the merits of the wine, fairly average... I understand that the winery has more than one lable and other label is their premium wines.  I look forward to when that is available (I went two weeks ago so maybe it already is)     Location..   what''s not to like?  On the pier!  A wonderful outdoor patio,  couldn''t have a nicer setting to enjoy your tasting....   The staff were super, super nice,  I would give them an A+!  

So why only three stars?  It is because of the wine club!  Very expensive for the quality of the wines and stingy as HELL with the benefits to the members..   Most wine clubs will give you a free tasting every time you come in (after all, we are your best customers... we are the ones who buy your wine time and time again).  Some wineries will give their members a complimentary glass in leau of a tasting (Carr).   Most wineries allow you to bring guests which is how you get new wine club members.   This system works folks!  The way this wine club works is that you are given a very limited number of passes per quarter, five as I recall.   If I come with my wife once a month we wouldn''t even be covered... let alone if we bring a guest!   

So go to this winery if you want to enjoy a tasting in one of the most beautiful settings on earth.   But avoid the wine club!  For that you can pretty much go to any of the other wine tasting rooms on the Urban wine trail."
SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,2404,OYrtEEEu0qLiTdwlPm9egQ,5,"I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature''s beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the wrong thing (cioppino). That wasn''t very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn''t ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I''ve had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon."

_W9lITxMHNInaS2Lv2XoUw,Casa Del Mar Inn,18 Bath St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,194,-5k_80Y-C0TYXkkUd_tjRw,4,"This place was cute and was in a great location!  It is one block up from the beach and wharf, two blocks over from State Street.  Parking was convenient, and our room was a King overlooking the courtyard and spa on the ground floor.  If there were people in the spa, they could be heard, but the noise didn''t bother since the spa closed at 9pm.  The room was clean with a nice couch to lounge on, a refrigerator, a nice fireplace, ample closet and counter space, and a nice bathroom.  The wine and cheese at 5 was a nice touch as well.  Although this place didn''t have a lot of extras, it was a pleasant stay, friendly and helpful staff, a good price, perfect location, and suited our needs just fine for a place in Santa Barbara.  My only complaint was that the room got a little stuffy, but was fine once we opened the windows and used the ceiling fan to air it out.  Would consider staying here again."
k3lTRgvPvYUI-cX7_TAqNA,University Club of Santa Barbara,1332 Santa Barbara St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,76,5Ord-c6rkWrbWWz39i6J5g,5,"I am so glad we had our wedding here!!! I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! 

We first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.

The looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara''s cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.

What I didn''t realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. 

The attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who''s name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.

Five stars all around. It was absolutely a joy to have our wedding here."
SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,2404,EyKE4PxF1DocfP2cCCD8qQ,3,"For a seafood restaurant at the edge of pear expectations should be set high. My wife and I have come here 3 times now and ordered different plates off the menu each time. This last time we ordered cioppino, clam chowder, and a crab salad sandwich;
*Good - clam chowder (excellent flavor and consistency) would order again.
*Not great - cioppino (lacked flavor & a variety of sea food/lack there of) would not order again
*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again 
The overall experience is okay, better if seated outside right on the pear overlooking the ocean, inside is very small. Service is good but be prepared to wait a bit to be seated. 
Is it worth a visit? Yes, but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and miss."

Here in Santa Barbara, it does not get any fresher. Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don''t expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view). It is the variety of fresh shellfish prepared according to your appetite and taste buds. The wait can be long during peak hours but it is worth it. Put your name down and take a walk on the peer to free-up some extra room in your stomach - you''ll need it!"

Cute space ( a bit hard to find ). The green eggs and ham  breakfast biscuit is to die for.  ($10 I think) The Santa Barbra tri tip sandwich was excellent! Cold brew coffee was good.

Hard to justify $16 for a burger and fries BUT wowow this burger was so delicious. I''m not sure if I was just starving but ordered the Lama burger and the patty size is quality. They also have random ingredients thrown in that you probably haven''t seen before like gruyere stuffed in a pepper on your burger. Fries came out nice and crisp vs. soggy and the bun on that burger was great. You order inside by the Nook and then can sit around. They have tons of craft beer to choose from and I could see this place getting packed on the weekends."
I0jFTYVDs-WHwKR2XHQlRA,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,425 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,347,AyZIiDWJFuJnLve6wG9Exw,4,"I think if I could, I would give Zen Yai a 3.5 stars, but alas, c''est la vie. 

The prices for their curry are excellent, at less than $12. Zen Yai is a tiny place, which is both good and bad. Good if you don''t have to wait, because it is nice and cozy, but bad if enough people eat here on a given evening -- because you may just have to wait a while.

I like the decor a lot, and the use of colors. The tables and plates are full of refreshingly bright colors. 

The service was fine, and the food was at our table in no time.

My Pineapple curry was excellent! And the rice is served in the shape of a pyramid, which is fun. 

All that being said, my girlfriend had a less than pleasurable experience. She is a seasoned green curry lover, and was disappointed with their green curry offering."

It''s tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it''s a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn''t impressed. It''s served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn''t love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try."

I have to say, this place is great and one of the biggest reasons why is their bar staff. There is a bartender named Ally. She is always kind and attentive.

Cool vibe, great indoor and outdoor seating. Great addition to the Funk Zone.
Definitely go!!
PS: Say hi to Ally for me :-)"

We always get the hash. Dawn Patrol is always super generous with the food portioning...with the hash, that is. My brother got a burger to go, and all it was was a piece of meat between two buns. However, he said the burger was really good, but still, I feel that they could''ve melted some cheese on top of the patty. All of their pastries, bread and jellies are homemade - and really delicious!"

I would literally give this place 0 stars if I could. I''ve never felt the urge to write a review before but I''m just so dumbfounded with how I was treated this evening. The bouncer was the rudest person I''ve ever met. I was very patient and polite with him when it was my turn and I smiled at him when he shined the light on me and that''s when he asked me for another form of ID. This was foreign to me because I''ve literally never had anyone question my PASSPORT ID! I told him no and he made me leave (grabbed me when I tried to get my friends attention to tell her they wouldn''t let me in). So I''m already annoyed and I kind of made a scene but I went all the way to my car to grab my license (which doesn''t have my picture cause I''m from WA and I renewed via mail) and my debit card which has my picture on it as well. I wait in the long line again only for him to tell me I don''t believe these are you without even looking at my 2 new forms of ID. He didn''t even try to ask me any specific questions to see if it''s me (ID #, weight, etc) he just singled me out of my group of 15+ people like an as*hole. I was literally so confused at this man trying to tell me that multiple pictures of me are not me... Needless to say, I''m going to make a phone call or two tomorrow because this is unacceptable and very unprofessional and should not be tolerated."

Its not easy to make a soy or almond milk latte and they do it the best and consistently each time.  They have a great assembly line system at the cash register and barista station that keeps the line moving fast.  Even at peak times, when its fully crowded, I never have a long wait.  They have a couple gluten-free baked goods to select from that are also top notch.  Sometimes I get a chamomile magic bowl and the hot apple cider as an alternative to caffeine."

I like the idea of make your own hash but the components need work. The corned beef was soggy when it should have been crispy. The over easy eggs were closer to medium. The potatoes, spinach and mushrooms were fine as was the cheddar. The accompanying salad was not as fresh as it could have been. Lastly for $13 in a casual order at the counter place, the portions were small.

The space itself is wonderful with a number of seating options indoors and out. Everything is neat and attractive and well laid out. 

Service is pleasant and competent.

My husband and I met in Santa Barbara so it was only fitting that we got married in a place that reminded us of where it all began. One of the things I loved about the venue is it''s rich history in Santa Barbara and how beautifully the architecture and gardens photograph. The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy. It was just the right amount of space and with all of the different room kept things interesting for our guests and allowed people to spread out across the different rooms and patios. I would highly recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone looking for a classy, iconic and romantic wedding venue in Santa Barbara."

The place is clean and nicely decorated. The main house is pretty and has a nice restaurant. Everyone was nice and helpful when we asked for directions or restaurant recommendations.

Good soup, excellent fresh side salad with great ranch dressing and the crab plate was huge, plenty of crab for one person. They had great service, beautiful location (it literally sits out on the end of the pier with outdoor seating). The only reason I give this four stars is there was nothing on the menu that did not have seafood. My poor husband got the side salad and we had to go somewhere else to get him food.

Everything was completely redone - new furniture, fixtures, bed, bathroom, floors, everything was beautiful.  And the beds!! ahh the beds, soooo comfortable.  I got a great night sleep.

This time you were on point Castillo Inn! I reserved the same room as last time because it was very roomy and pretty. There were four of us. The tp and towels were stocked nicely and we didn''t run out of either. The wifi was free and fast. The morning breakfast treats were great. My mom loved having her coffee, pastries and fruit. The beds were very comfy. Loved being so close to everything. We didn''t have to drive much since everything is a short walk away, or you can ride the trolleys or the water taxi. Had so much fun!

Washers range from $3-$6.50 and dryers are $.25 or $.50 for 7-8 minutes (depends on size).  
There are always staff around and they''re nice and helpful.  I think they also offer washing/folding services - ask the front desk.  
Parking is not usually an issue unless it''s peak after work hours.  Walk to Starbucks while you wait - or sit at one of their tables or chairs and enjoy their free wifi.  Forget the quarters- this place uses laundry cards you can refill on your Visa/MasterCard.

The only negative was the strangely scheduled demolition of their parking lot on a Sunday morning at 10am.  I mean, we were up and all but we were asked to move our car and then the noise was just insane.  Thankfully we checked out that day at 11am.

The food was cooked fresh!  I mean from being alive in the tank to killed and cooked right behind you. 
We ordered Lobster and rock crab both were amazing. We also had the lobster bisque which I thought needed more flavor.

The beer was ice cold and the food was hot and fresh. Service was outstanding once we actually got seated."

Make sure to make it up to the view and climb the stairs  (resist the urge to take the elevator) to watch  the clock/bell at work. The view, although not super high, is breathtaking and gives you a good look at the beauty of Santa Barbara.

We saw high schoolers doing some sort of club activity here (maybe MUN?) but that didn''t stop us from enjoying the courthouse. You are free to walk he grounds--no intrusive security guards or large tour groups. It didn''t feel so touristy/museum-y either which for some reason made me appreciate the experience all the more.

The best part of all--it''s free! You won''t need to set aside a ton of time here (maybe 30-45 min). There''s ample street parking around the courthouse, at least on a weekend so get over here stat!"

The Shellfish Company is a good name for this restaurant as there is all kind of yummy seafood.  I opted for the Maine Lobster tacos that had fresh avocado, a spicy mayo dip on the side, lettuce, tomatoes, served on 2-double tortillas with rice.  The wine menu is generic, but I had a nice glass of Santa Barbara Wine Company Chardonnay along with a 2nd glass of generic White Zin.  They do not have espresso or dessert, but that was no big deal as the experience was perfect.  Good window views and seats at the bar... it is small and I would anticipate on the weekends the place is near impossible to get into.

Incredible experience: The ingenuity, the flavor, the precision, the plating, and the service were flawless.

I''ve read other reviews as to ambience and it puzzles me as the beauty in Japanese style and aesthetics is about simplicity. It further underscores that with simplicity as the backdrop, the food can truly be the hero of the moment as described above.

The only heartbreak of the evening is that we discovered the Chef and his lovely proprietor wife  lived in San Francisco. So my city lost a jewel; nevertheless, happy for Santa Barbara for their new found treasure.  

Promise you this: My Chef partner and I will not be waiting until another birthday to enjoy in the delight of Yoichi''s."

The Eagle Inn was worth every penny! yummy free breakfast everyday, free bike rentals, free movie check out to enjoy in  your room! we stayed in a king jacuzzi room and it was a beautiful!  2 person shower, and a private little patio with seating at the corner of the building. We loved taking the bikes out since there was a beach trail 2 blocks from the hotel! Since we were their to get married, they treated us to a free romance package! Everyone was kind and courteous and is a great place to enjoy some quality time with a loved one!  The only note I have to anybody staying here is that there is nobody on staff after 10 p.m. (and unfortunately there are 2 advertisements on premises claiming their is security) and they lock the main entrance to the hotel....which you need your room key to get in and out of. We stepped outside to grab something out of car just after  10 p.m. in our pj''s and got LOCKED OUT of not only the hotel, but also our room on our wedding night!!! it took 45 minutes to have an off property security guard come to let us in the hotel and our room....and since our key didnt work anymore and there was nobody to make us a new one, we had to wait until morning ( and not leave our room again) to get a new one. It was so unfortunate that this happened, - even more so on our wedding night. It really put a sour taste in our mouth since they advertise there is someone on site at night and there isnt...thats just not okay to do. So beware and make sure your keys work if you have to leave late at night! other than this incident, the hotel was fabulous and the staff was very kind.

Calm chowder had good pieces of clam but the soup was pretty thick - it is ok, not as good as some reviews here claim.  Crab cakes were also ok.

It was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn''t have to wait that long to be seated. There was seating both outside and inside, but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.

My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.

Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter. 

I definitely will come back here again cause pricey as it was we definitely got our monies worth!"

We love sitting at the bar and indulging on half price sushi for lunch and dinner. We love their beer selection, and the place is trendy and a lot of fun. I do not like the fact that they include gratuity on the bill, and sometimes the 50 percent off seems to be closer to 47 percent... Now, since the rolls are small, one ends up spending about as much money as one would at a place with a regular price on sushi, but one ends up getting more food and a bigger variety of rolls."

I visited my sister in LA and she sprung on the great surprise that we were headin'' to Santa Barbara for the weekend.  

The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern''s Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. 

We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine''s is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain''t scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.  My one critique is that I thought the Spider Crab was over cooked.  It by no means ruined the meal and may not be noticed by most but I know my seafood. 

Overall one of the best experiences ever.  If you go to Santa Barbra you MUST go here!"

Oh-em-gee he was right. BEST clam chowder EVER. We also got the coconut shrimp and the shrimp ceviche. These plates were meh. The ceviche wasn't a true ceviche since the shrimp wasn't actually cooked in lime. It felt more like a salad. Coconut shrimp was better but the accompanying fries and coleslaw was below average.

My service received as a customer of Mailbox Express II over the last 16 years has been exceptional. There have been many occasions that Mike Pico''s expertise, knowledge and willingness to go the extra step has been the difference between my having been successful and not. I consider myself lucky to have found Mailbox Express II. If there is one thing that I have come to value during my nomadic lifestyle it is the value of having a highly dependable fixed base location to send and receive all my critical correspondences and high-value packages through. I know I will continue to move to and from the U.S. in the future, and I also know I will always keep my box at Mailbox Express II."

My favorite spot in the funk zone to hang out, especially on a Sunday afternoon. Sip on a glass of wine or try a beer sampler- whatever you are in the mood for! They have both, unlike most wine tasting spots around there. If it''s a chilly day, warm up by the cozy fireplace and relax by the lounge area... or if it''s a warm day you can people watch on the wrap-around porch in the front.  Corks and Crowns is a classy, friendly place for locals and visitors alike.  And they are dog friendly. Did I mention they also have cupcake pairings for your sweet tooth? So decadent and tasty...

1. Close to train station and just a short walk to the beach and State St.
2. It''s quiet. Even though it only took us ten minutes to walk here from the Amtrak station, you could only hear the trains at night way off in the distance. Castillo St. is a slightly busy street, but our room (#17) was set back from the street, so we didn''t notice traffic noise at night. 
3. Clean, clean, clean. There was no ew feeling when you walked in the door. I''m a bit of a germaphobe and this place passed my picky expectations. 
4. Modern and new feeling. The fixtures, granite counters and granite shower (with good water pressure), bed, and flat screen TV were all new...or at least they seemed like it. 
5. The staff were friendly. They seemed like the kind of folks you''d meet in a quaint, small-town sort of a place. Check in and check out were super fast. They let us keep our excess baggage there on the last day while we wandered Santa Barbara a little more before our train left. 

Thanks, Castillo Inn. We''ll be back!"

First of all, the music! Yes. Good hip-hop that you can actual dance to. And there''s no cover, yay! 2 friends and I had to wait in line for about 5 minutes around 11 on a Saturday night, which wasn''t too bad. I thought it was pretty small at first but there is a back area and maybe even an upstairs. I don''t know, but I do know I liked the vibe in the front area. It''s divey but fun. They were playing music videos on the tv''s and there was a DJ on an elevated platform in the corner. Our bartender was nice and made good drinks... potent but not unbearably strong. There weren''t too many creepers here either. Phew. Drinks were reasonably priced too.

I would recommend coming here if you enjoy hip-hop music and dancing. It is kind of a younger crowd overall, but there were some older people in the mix too. It was super close to our hotel which was very convenient. The only thing I wasn''t keen on was the smell... uh not super fresh but whatever."

I didn''t realize how close it was to Lower State street and a little walk to the beach.

To switch things up, I ordered the Dragon Bowl which had pitaya, mangoes, kiwis, and bananas. The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn''t so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you''re not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl. 

The acai bowls are a little more on the pricier side~ $9 but it is a filling meal.

One of those places when you step in the door, you instantly feel like you''re on vacation.

There''s a fireplace in the corner with a cozy set-up, you''ll swear you''re in a living room of a snug b&b. Also, a bar where you can sit and speak with one of the knowledgable and friendly members of their staff about what kind of wine you''d like to try.

Great place for a date, girls night or if you want to have a wine tasting experience in a great atmosphere. They offer several different tasting flights of wine (and beer) for a really reasonable price. If you''re a regular, look into getting a membership. I spent hours here with a friend sipping wine and relaxing. A must see spot if you like great wine and conversation.

I really appreciate that the rice they served with the curry was a good hefty helping and not dry like other places.  The curries are really rich with flavor...so good!  The price is pretty much about $10-12 per person on average for a standard plate.  It goes up a bit for the more fancy add-ins.

And for those of you who can''t handle spicy too well like me, don''t forget to request it mild because they won''t ask you how you like it and it''ll come served with a kick like it''s supposed to (still yummy though...just order two more glasses of water lol).  We ordered the pumpkin curry, pineapple curry, and pad thai.

Love the food, but the venue is pretty cramped."

I guess I thought it would be similar to those I find at the beach cities of San Diego.

I was a little shocked at how small it was.  It is one of the bigger farmers markets that I have been to, but I guess I still had those expectations.

The location is really nice because you can also stop by state street for an additional outing.  However, I wasn''t a fan of the group of homeless people and beggars that you have to walk through to enter the market.

In terms of the vendors, they have the typical fruits and veggies, eggs, meat, flowers, etc.  I was a fan of this pie that I was given a sample of on my way out of the market."

I rented out a two-people kayak for $30, and we were allowed to ride it for 3 hours, which is a pretty decent deal. I paddled the kayak around the port. it''s a great place to kayak because there are areas where the waves are calm, and if you want, you can go out into the ocean and ride along the shores.

Parking is kind of crummy, but we ended up always getting a spot. 
Parking on the street is allowed on weekends, with a permit (which the inn does not provide)

I give this place 5 stars because the service was quick and friendly. Also, it is definitely one of the best Pitaya (dragonfruit) Bowls I have ever had.

This location is far more spacious and still preserves the whimsy and artsy atmosphere I liked in the first location. I ordered the Magic Bowl and it was absolutely amazing. The baristas were also very courteous.

I think this spot is more ideal for doing work or studying on a nice afternoon. Just a few blocks away from State St., it is a bit quieter and less crowded. It''s a bit strange that the two locations would be so close to one another, but my guess is that they cater to slightly different crowds (studiers vs. shoppers), so I''ll take it."

We got the king room with hot tub and fireplace. Utilized both and had such a romantic weekend. It was pretty close to everything too.

I took my girlfriend here for a weekend (Fri - Sun) for a combo birthday + Christmas gift and everything went perfect. They had the room set up with rose pedals when we walked in the first time, then I asked if they could set up champagne and chocolate covered strawberries when we went out for dinner.

When we got back for dinner the champagne, strawberries, and candles we all set up perfectly! My girlfriend was very surprised. Then they helped me schedule a couples massage that evening, which was another surprise. So the first afternoon / evening there was absolutely perfect.

The vibe of this inn is very boutique, quaint, and charming. Perfect for couples. We could also use the bikes daily (for free), which we did. They gave us great suggestions on where to go and what to do. Both State Street, the beach, and the train station are all walking distance.

CWdCNIJU4Kh480NV9dgQjw,Third Window Brewing,"406 E Haley St, Ste 3",Santa Barbara,CA,93101,183,Vt3gsOf4LMs68XJBxFRFiA,5,"4-star beer, 5-star ambiance. This is the most impressive and promising brewery in Santa Barbara. 

Inside they have a high ceiling, exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list. It looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels, which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like IBUs, ABV, style, volume poured. The list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours, Berliners, stouts, pilsners, and IPAs.

They offer very nice tasting flights, which our group did. You grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try. This system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process - a great idea. The beer quality was a bit all over the place, which is expected from a new brewery. However, some showed a lot of promise and I think Third Window has what it takes to improve their recipes. Detailed notes are below. I ended up liking their pilsner, The Light, the best and got it in a large format mug pour. 

Pretzels and popcorn are available, which is a nice touch. Dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well.

~~~~~~~~~

Extra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery:

The Light 1.1
This was an outstanding German style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness. Hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated. The flavor was dry and a tad powdery, but the finish was neutral and refreshing. This was my absolute favorite of the beers I tried so I got a large pour in a giant mug. 

Brett Saison
Looking beautiful in the glass, glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation. The aroma is sawdust, barn, candied mango. The flavor is bubbly, neautral, and very dry but not abrasive. Refreshing, though a tad washed out in the flavor.

Rakau Welch
Looking identical to the Brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits, lemongrass, dill, fennel, oregano - super herbal. The flavor is dry, neutral, refreshing. The farmyard character of saison is spot on here. Simple, dry, but not abrasive.

Xexo
Super dry for an IPA that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor, but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive. Needed some work. 

The ÖKO BOMB
Inky black in color, but much too thin a body for stout. The nose is savory chocolate mousse, big raisin, chocolate covered raisin. But the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda, grape cough syrup and tootsie roll.

Executioner''s Daughter
Clear amber in color. This one had intense vinegar (acetic acid) and nail polish remover (ethyl acetate) in the nose. Taste is very nice, however, with cinnamon, mild sugar, dark bread, banana nut bran muffin. Great mouthfeel.

The Origin 2016
This was billed as a dry-hopped APA, but the aroma was sticky with thick caramel and butterscotch. The flavor was watery and bland. Overall, it seemed dead and not what was intended."

The service was good despite the long wait and huge crowd, but the food itself was subpar. I ate the lobster bisque in a bread bowl and a crab sandwich. The bisque was too tomatoey and I didn''t even see and lobster chunks in it, and the bread bowl was NOT fresh. The crab sandwich was decent, but flavorless, you could hardly tell that it was crab. My mother had the lobster roll which was apparently delicious, though ridiculously overpriced at $20. The clam chowder was thick and buttery, and the bread bowl was once again stale.

We opted for beer tastings and were surprised at the poor quality of the offerings and that none of them were from anywhere near this area (they serve Figueroa Mountain but not in our tastings). I like sampling beers from farther afield, but I''d expect them to represent more of a best of.

I did the tasting that included IPAs--one of them was about the worst I''ve tasted and the other not much better. Also, it didn''t seem to make a lot of sense to offer a tasting that combined IPAs with several particularly insipid brews.

Service was particularly unenthusiastic."
MAIfD4kJDCydgoD1l2b_vw,Corks n' Crowns,32 Anacapa St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,276,qbWqqmkUyAZIrQ57cGm7Yg,1,"This review is based purely on my last experience at this place. The employees were extremely rude, and therefore I felt it necessary to write this review.

 I am a local, born and raised, and have come here many times. I had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to show them around the funk zone. We stopped in to grab a glass of wine, and two of us decided to use the restroom. Apparently there is a sign on the door that says only person can use the restroom at a time. However, I did not see the sign, which was an honest mistake on my part. My friend and I went into the bathroom together. Less than 30 seconds after going into the restroom, we heard a loud banging on the door. This happened three times during the 2-3 minutes max we were in the restroom. I hadn''t even had a chance to wash my hands yet when my friend opened the door to see who was banging on the door, and this very drunk girl comes running in, screaming at us. She proceeded to pull down her pants in front of us and started peeing. I have never seen anything like it. She accused of us of taking too long and causing her to pee on the floor. When we walked outside, we saw a puddle of her pee on the floor. Then an employee came up to us and told us that we shouldn''t have been in there together, and we said sorry we didn''t know. 

We then went back to grab our glasses of wine that we had ordered and tried to find a place to sit. As I was walking through the doorway, a girl bumped into me. It was the girl who peed on the floor. She then called me a racist name and walked outside. We ignored her and decided to stay and let it go. One of my other friends went up to order another glass of wine, and they refused to serve her, telling us that we had been kicked out. When we asked her why, she said it was because there were two of us in the bathroom. Then, a second employee with a British accent came walking over, and said in an EXTREMELY RUDE manner, You guys were kicked out a long time ago, I don''t know what you are still doing here. I tried to explain to her that we had no idea we were kicked out, but she wouldn''t listen.

Eventually, someone (maybe the manager) else came over, and told us that we had to go because we caused a girl to pee on their floor because we were in the bathroom too long. We tried to tell them that we were only in the bathroom for a couple of minutes. We weren''t even in there long enough for me to wash my hands because this girl was being so disruptive and rude. However, it made no difference. They didn''t even give us a chance to explain our side of the story. Meanwhile, they let a racist drunk girl stay even though she was the one who peed on their floor.

And finally, to top it off, when we walked outside, that same girl was out on the sidewalk drinking the wine from this establishment, which is illegal. 

Now normally I would never write a bad review. In fact, I have never written one before. However, this was the rudest treatment of any establishment that I have ever seen. It was especially frustrating because I was showing my friends around my town, and to be treated this way was unacceptable. I will never go back to this place, which is sad, because I liked it before this happened."

However I didn''t feel like getting one the second I sat down. One of the baristas just came up to me and basically accused me of not getting a drink.

It''s not like I look fucking homeless here with my Mac and nice clothes. Actually baffled hahaha I wish I wasn''t so pleasant when she spoke with me.

I went in to get a ring for a facial piercing and the man working was so condescending and rude, telling me I was disrespectful for touching my nose in the shop. He could have easily told me nicely that that was a rule they had, but instead he made me feel like a complete idiot. The woman working was nice and helped me out. But they charged me for two rings that didn''t even fit and then tried telling me to wait a couple months and try to stretch out my hole instead of just offering to refund the money. They also tried telling me most places don''t sell 20 gauges and then I went to the tattoo shop across the street and they told me completely otherwise. Luckily, it ended up working out because the people at energy tattoo actually have good customer service and helped me out. 
Bad vibes from golden eagle. Won''t be going here again."

I get back to my car and realize that he forgot the blueberries, kiwi, and 80% of the agave. called back to let them know the customer service was horrible and that my toppings were forgotten and was simply told uhhhhh okay. i immediately hung up after i heard no apology whatsoever."

We wanted a low key night so we walked around the corner to the brew house which is a local bar around the corner and recommended by one of our tour guides.

Cage free eggs were cooked well. Sausages were very high quality and not fatty. Even the jam that came with the toast was pretty good. It tasted natural, not too sweet with actual fruit preserves in it!

The luau french toast , made on hawaiian bread was pretty good too.

The only downside is that the wait for the food itself is a bit longer ,but nothing unreasonable. I think it took about 15 to 20 minutes for the food to come out. As long as you have some time to spare , I would recommend giving this place a try. Ingredients are healthy and fresh.

quickly:
Crab cakes - tender and crumbly. They don''t taste like crab which is what I prefer. The crab cakes come with a side of gianormos onion rings (i loved those).

clam chowder - pretty standard. it didn''t blow your mind, but it also wasn''t too fishy which can happen with clam chowder.

We saw everyone ordering crab and lobster, and we just salivated at the thought - we had dinner plans later that day so we couldn''t try any of the big shellfish items. They definitely looked delicious!

some notes: 
-The indoor seating is limited. It''s a small shack at the end of the pier. It was cold and windy the day we were there (yeah, can you believe it?) so there was more of a wait to sit inside.
- not good for big groups indoors
-parking is free with validation"

Did not disappoint!!  I expected the taste of ham and pineapple pizza, but I got Mexican tacos on my taste buds!  Growing up with Sonoran Mexican food,  I loved this unexpected find.

We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant''s advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.

I will probably return here, but only because it is the only establishment in the entire city with tapan tables. The service is horrible."

The SB farmer''s market is where people actually seem to shop and buy things, whereas the Berkeley farmer''s market is really too expensive, and you just go there to be seen.  The SB farmer''s market has great musicians.  In contrast, the Berkeley market''s musicians must know someone at the Ecology Center, its operator.  The SB Farmer''s market is big, while the one at Berkeley is small.  The SB market has parking, amazingly, whereas the Berkeley one doesn''t.  The SB market doesn''t have small eats yet the Berkeley one does.  The SB market has lots of lovely flowers while the Berkeley market seems to have a smaller selection.

If you visit SB, the farmer''s market is definitely worth a visit.  If you visit Berkeley, go to the Berkeley Bowl."

But then I heard they have half-price (select) sushi on weekdays! So of course we had to go try it out. 

The only thing I''d complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can''t sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you''re only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people. 

The sushi was pretty good, although some rolls could have been made better. They were obviously in a rush since they had so many customers and so the service wasn''t that great. But for $19 (not including tax + gratuity) we got 4 rolls and 4 pieces of nigiri. Overall pretty good for my sushi cravings when I''m on a tight budget."

I landed at The French Press once, after being away from Santa Barbara for awhile. I remember sitting at one of their sunny, steel tables outside. Pretty dogs and Santa Barbarans abounded. I sat yesterday on one of their bar seats facing the all-window front, a diorama of Pleasantville spread out before me. Every bit of sunshine and view I took in was assuring me, ''everything is alright, things are good here.'' And so it is. I hope The French Press keeps the vibe."

1. You are literally 2 blocks away from the beach, walking to local wine bars in the area is 10 minutes, walking to downtown State St. is roughly 10-15 minutes, and the best local bar in town is a 5 minute walk down the street.

2. Had two double queen rooms for 8 guests and it was plenty roomy. They even got us an air bed in one because we had 3 couples and two singles. The air bed was even a nicer aerobed!

3. Free beach cruiser rental! We rode to downtown the morning after to get some coffee at The Press.

4. They have a simple breakfast for you included in the price. The standard OJ, fruit, and then a bagel with lox, tomato, and lettuce. It''s sufficient to keep you held over until 11a or noon.

5. It was very clean and reception was very nice.

Would absolutely stay at this place next time we are in Santa Barbara."

I originally try to book with aqua sports, but they were booked solid. They referred me to Santa Barbara Adventure Company and I could not have been more satisfied. Our guide Adam was professional and extraordinarily informative. You could tell he had a real passion for his job and shared his knowledge of the history of the island and its local inhabitants. I seriously considered bringing my own kayak and going it alone but I''m so glad I didn''t. I went in areas that I never would have considered, but never felt forced to do so. Our group had approximately''s five kayaks and all of us were novices. I consider myself an intermediate just because I''d been in kayaks before but after the trip I realized how much I really didn''t know! Adam was very patient and never forced anyone to do anything they weren''t comfortable doing, and I never felt rushed. These guys deserve six stars.

Quite by chance, we chose the perfect time to dine here, and as a result we witnessed during the course of our meal both the sunset and the moonrise, followed shortly after by a light fog swallowing the coastline. With the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us, it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal. It was late in the day and, having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing, we were ravenous, so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense New England style clam chowder. We followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels, served in a white wine and garlic broth, every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty French Bread, and then splitting an order of calamari, sauteed in butter, garlic, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini. Including tax and tip, we stuffed ourselves for only $17.00 each! The very nautical decor and bustling open-air kitchen add to your dining enjoyment. There''s a long bar (where food is also served) that seats a couple of dozen, and a massive aquarium - with water pumped up from the ocean below - houses lobsters and crabs just brought in from the surrounding waters. Other waterfront spots in Santa Barbara easily will cost twice as much for a far less satisfying meal. If you''re looking for seafood, this is THE place to eat while in town."

My friend and I got a recommendation for this place because of its half price Sushi Monday-Thursday.  I always get a little nervous when I hear about deals on sushi but we decided to try it out and boy am I glad we did.  Not only was the sushi a great price but it tasted really good, we got to sit and watch the chef prepare all of our food which always makes me comfortable with what I am eating but also makes me want to make my own sushi since it looks pretty easy.  Was this sushi absolutely amazing? No but it was worth paying $ 13 for 3 rolls and very enjoyable."

I guess you could call me a pesky customer. I had a lot of questions before I selected which coffee I was buying which were all cheerfully answered. I was intrigued by their cold brew and the batista explained process and taste and offered me a sample. Love the customer service thanks guys! 
Between my group I tried 2 blends of coffee, one french pressed one espresso, and the Tres leches coffee which was unique and yummy. I suggest trying it. It''s sweet and creamy but not enough to take away from the coffee''s flavor.

However, the Granada Theater is a very intimate setting and has a very classic ambiance to it. I got to sit in the orchestra seating somewhat close to the stage and had a pretty decent view. I also sat in the box seats which are close as well, however it''s at an angle, therefore it depends on the performance and if you''d rather have a direct view or not. The seats in the orchestra level are quite comfortable and plushy, I''m assuming the balcony seats are the same. I cannot say the same for box seats they are not as comfortable. 

The theater is small, but still quite beautiful. 

In addition the staff are very nice people.

We loved the location (very easy to walk to the beach and get to the main shopping area.  We found the staff to be friendly and helpful with all of our requests. The kitchen staff even remembered my two year old''s likes and dislikes at breakfast! 

We arrived and realized that our room didn''t have the tub that we requested at check in, but the front desk employee quickly changed our room and put us in the back building (which was actually better for us - considering the kiddo - a bit more isolated) and apologized for the confusion.  

We enjoyed our private patio feature and he large bathroom.  I also appreciated the amenities provided in our room.  Make-up remover was a nice thing to have provided in the room (though they stopped replacing it half way through our stay) and we also enjoyed the option of being able to bike places (as the hotel provided bike rentals).  My only complaint about the amenities is that they seemed to stop replenishing things towards the end of our stay (didn''t replace shower caps, make-up remover, soap or tissues in the bathroom the last two days).  

I thought the provided breakfast was a a pretty good quality of food and we never had a problem getting seated or asking for substitutions to our dishes (though we do not have any allergies) and everyone was friendly and helpful.  I would definitely recommend and stay again."

I was excited to try out this place because I''ve never ate down on a wharf before and I was in Santa Barbara doing SB Buggy so I thought this place would be perfect for dinner. 

---Parking ----
can be found on the streets or public parking building or park on the wharf.

---Seating---
Wait time depending of if you want FA (first available), O (outside), I (inside) seating. 

I prefer the outside seating because there are more space to put your dishes and you get the view of the ocean. So why not. 

I thought this place would bigger than I thought, there are bar seating inside, and table seating outside. 

---Restroom----
1 only

----Food----
Dungeness crab- 2-2.5 lbs for $23.95/lb. It came with a whole crab and butter dipping sauce. It was fresh and tender. Really good!! Recommend!!

Crab Cakes--$13.95. It was good but nothing really special about it. The tartar sauce was really good with it.

Calamari Pasta-$14.95. The calamari was fresh and tender and flavorful along with the pasta. 

New England Style Clam Chowder- $7.95 for a Bowl of Soup. It was ehh. I thought it would be tastier since a lot of people rave about it. I would skip this.

---Service---

Not that the rooms are horrible, they just aren''t worth the $220 a night (but the location is).  The floors are some sort of linoleum - and the walls are paper thin.  Please be considerate of your neighbors and don''t walk around in your heals on these floors for an hour - put your shoes on when you head out the door.  The beds are comfortable and clean, and the bathroom (room 33) was huge.  Pretty sure these are old converted apartments and I liked the little touches of architecture like the arched doorway in our bathroom.  

Our porch light was broken and even after notifying the front desk, the bulb was never replaced -  for $200 a night they should replace the light bulb so I can see to unlock my door.  Breakfast was nothing special - muffins and bagels, but at least it wasn''t those pastries that are in individual plastic bags like you find out at the gas station.  I suggest walking the 1 block to Sambos for breakfast.

Although I didn''t get in the Jacuzzi it did make me giggle - it''s about the size of a bathtub and has 4 or 5 lounge chairs around it and a giant no lifeguard on duty sign.  Yeah - there is no way I''m going in if there is no lifeguard!"

Normally I find places near the water to have fresh, albeit simple, delicious seafood, unfortunately it was not the case at this shanty by the sea.

The prices were super inflated and not all of their seafood was fresh, which should have been the first major indicator that our group should dine elsewhere.

Also really need to get some shades to pull down on the Windows. In the afternoon the sun blinds you in most of the indoor searing unless you''re against the wall."

About 4 tables were occupied. 6 were in our party and no line to place our order. We felt the cost was excessive for what we received. $11 for 2 poached eggs, 2 small over cooked hard sage sausages, a scoop of sweet potato hash and a scone. I gave the scone an extra star. We sat at the big table in the corner which was nice. Thank heavens we didn''t get drinks for everyone, we would have been over $100 for breakfast - crazy expensive. The bathroom was nothing special as stated in their advertisement. The black toilet was weird. You can''t tell if someone left a load or not in there. Yuck. 

Everyone walked away saying the portions were small and nothing special for the price. We will not return."

I was scared it was going to be a tourist trap due to the location. Prices were high but it was well worth it. We came about 1115am 15 minutes after opening. We could''ve sat inside and gotten seated right away but instead we waited for an outside table to clear which took about 30 minutes. My wife and I shared the following: Fried seafood platter, scallops and uni, oysters. Everything was great but the scallops and uni on top were the highlight. I would definitely come back here and splurge some more by getting a crab - but its just so hard to crack and eat haha."

The fruit was fresh, the smoothie well made and flavourful, and was pretty big for a medium size albeit it is a bit expensive.

To sum a bowl up, it would be putting Jamba Juice together with fresh fruit and other various ingredients. Definitely worth a try."

SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,2404,UkyFfi6_4_VHrFOk_F3BRg,5,"My favorite place to get shellfish (besides fresh off the pier on Saturday mornings). It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) 

My favorite moment:

I will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. 

Priced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. 

After that day, I couldn''t get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.

But be careful, a 3 pounder means you''re eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should''ve gotten both. It''s okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. 

Besides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. 

Okay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It''s so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling."

Great salsa bar with escabeche and they give you fresh chips with all meals.

I would like to try more of their menu but the tacos are soo good i keep getting those instead."
gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,Hibachi Steak House & Sushi Bar,502 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,488,ac2zDI9BpZtCKlVfNCNMaQ,1,"Probably one of the WORST experiences I''ve had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....

We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn''t enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn''t we be first to sit down? We didn''t care if the chef wasn''t ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. 

We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn''t ours and that wasn''t what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that''s what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I''m pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn''t find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn''t being cooked! EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, I''m sorry, I don''t need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you! (very politely) He then came back with ok well maybe if I take your plate away you''ll stop changing your mind WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won''t, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don''t come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it''s hard to always please everyone. But it''s unacceptable to be rude to people!!"

Living in the Midwest and missing the ocean, we were craving seafood.  I used my Yelp app on my phone to find this spot.  The location is great -- at the end of a pier overlooking the Pacific.  The atmosphere is very casual and family-friendly and parking is easy and can be validated.  My main disappointment with this place is that although all the fish and seafood was definitely fresh, the majority of it was flown in from other locales (mostly Atlantic Ocean).  It just seemed so silly to eat seafood flown in while sitting next to the ocean.  I had the crab sandwich (not local crab) and it was really delicious.  My husband had the lobster (from Maine) tacos and was disappointed.  I tasted it as well and found that they weren''t terrible but all the seasoning and additions really took away from the great taste of lobster.  Service was good, beers were good, and the location is great, so while I think this place is a solid 3.5 stars, I will bump it up to 4.  Can''t beat oceanfront dining!"

So for starters - I ordered the lobster roll. The dish was not to my liking, but that''s because I''m not a fan of celery in lobster rolls. The celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish. I also found the lobster overdressed. But some of this is just a matter of taste so I won''t ding them hard for that.

The rest of the food, given the price, was fantastic. The crab and lobster were all fresh, all cooked correctly, and all at a price that worked. 

It is rare to find a seafood restaurant these days that is reasonably priced and one that serves fresh good seafood. Most are either way too expensive or way too sucky. This is not one of them."

Breanna is an incredible coordinator--so lovely and warm to work with. 

After researching several venues, we decided that the Riviera Mansion was a great fit for us. The menu looked fantastic, the staff was super accommodating, and Breanna really worked with us and our wedding planner to help design the vision and look we were going for. We said we wanted everything to be outdoors...no problem. We said we wanted string lighting and chandeliers in the trees...no problem. We wanted to use all the ourdoor lawn for cocktail hour, dinner and dancing, have a live band and a dj, sweetheart table and cake table. If we dreamed it up, Breanna and the staff were all hands on deck to work to accommodate it. 

A few months before the event, we did our tasting for the menu. And the food was OUTSTANDING! Really great portions, delicious flavors and beautiful presentation. And I will say that the food was consistent from tasting to the actual wedding, and our guests RAVED about it. We even had people asking for seconds! Wedding food is never something that typically stands out, but I can say the steak and the fish options we had were absolutely delicious. And again, Breanna and the kitchen were able to accommodate when I requested that the fish needed to be wild and sustainably caught--again no problems.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the Food & Beverage manager, Eli. Eli was such a sweetheart--making sure we thought about everything during the preparation walk through meeting and that we were happy the day of and throughout the event. You can tell he takes great pride and joy in his job and venue.

Breanna, Eli and team were so flawless in organizing everything that we honestly had nothing to worry about--working with this venue was stress free, which made for two very happy brides. The venue is beautiful, the staff is so dedicated and happy, and the service was wonderful. I can''t say enough good things about the Riviera Mansion and their ability to host a great party!"

The lobster roll was nit what we expected becuae it was mostly filler than lobster not the big chunks of lobster and buttered roll you''d expect especially for $18.

We also knew that we wanted a DJ who would be able to read the crowd- we wanted our wedding to be a big happy party where the mood felt good and the people kept dancing. Finally, we did NOT want an MC-type DJ who was going to be center stage. 

When meeting with Gavin and Patrick, I got the sense that they knew their job was: help us get what we wanted (e.g. if we wanted a DJ to deal with making the music good and the party fun and not saying too much at all, they would do that) . I feel that if we''d wanted something different, they would have been able to provide that as well.

DJ Patrick from SBDJs did a stellar job. We were able to submit song lists on their website in advance, and they will get songs for you not in their list if you request them (up to a fairly generous limit, I think). We emailed him a special recording we wanted for part of our first dance, which we wanted mixed in a very specific way into another song, which he did perfectly. 

But those are the things a DJ is *supposed* to be able to do. What made him truly outstanding is that the dancing went on all night. Everyone commented on what great music and what a fun atmosphere it was. He played music we requested, but seamlessly picked similar-genre songs to complement it (some not from our extensive request list). Most importantly, he perfectly read the crowd, and if a particular song wasn''t working for our crowd, he subtly and skillfully mixed it into another song, and moved on to something better. 

We all have been to those weddings where a song comes on, and a minute later the dance floor is empty and yet the song limps on. Or where the DJ realizes it isn''t working and literally *turns off* the song, pause, then starts a new one while the confused dancers stand around. We had NONE of that. Highly recommend DJ Patrick with SBDJs."

FYI, no food here - just a small cheese plate, which was very nice to have while enjoying a wine flight. Unfortunately, the one worker was pathetic - a young man who clearly had no motivation to work. When we asked about the wines, all he would say is the name and the year, then plop the bottle in front of us so we could read it ourselves. He was honestly quite rude, as if we were inconveniencing him. The other lady working gave us very nice descriptions of each wine - we were very happy when she helped us out instead!
I recommend going - it is so relaxing with a wonderful view - but please ask one of the girls to help you out!"

In the planning phases Breanna did an excellent job of reminding me and keeping me on track for any due dates and fun things like our tasting.

 Speaking of tasting! We had the amazing fortune of having a fully customized wedding menu. I''m not sure my husband and I did a good job of describing what we wanted but, when we showed up for our tasting, it was what we wanted and didn''t even know we wanted. I had this vision of a modern and elegant take on some classic Mexican dishes. I wanted a chile relleno with a little pizzaz. Ours had yummy goat cheese white cream sauce with vibrant pomegranate and pumpkin seeds  sprinkled on top. I also wanted romantic and traditional chicken mole. Chef Harley nailed it. He was so concerned with every detail, it warmed my crazy bride soul! I could keep going. 

Now, don''t get me started about Eli! A saint. This man knows service. From our first tasting, to our walkthrough, to the day of, it doesn''t get any better. They most certainly exceed The Bacara (I''ve worked there).  Did I mention we made the crazy request for Pineapple cider and at our tasting they brought at least 10 varieties for us to try! I am beating myself up not remembering some of the other attendants on that day. I recall having a sweet and magical conversation with at least two folks who made sure I couldn''t stop smiling that day. They did everything from keeping a fresh coconut cocktail in my hand to ensuring my dad''s plate was full and my mom was charmed. 

On the day of, Breanna surprised me with a sweet gift, a MAC lipgloss for touchup. I actually happened to have lost my lipstick I had picked out and this gloss was my savior:)

I WOULD URGE ANY BRIDE WHO WANTS GREAT SERVICE, GREAT FOOD AND GREAT AMBIANCE TO HAVE THEIR SPECIAL DAY HERE."

The food is fresh and very good - plus reasonably priced. They had already run out of the Crab Legs we wanted, so we went with another crab dish that was also good. The lobster bisque was very good and the shrimp tacos were really great. I wish the chairs had backs on them though - we sat indoors and most of the seats are bar stools - so kind of uncomfortable."

We borrowed a pack and play for our son during our stay.  Very convenient!   I would recommend they provide a flat sheet for the bottom to be folded around it.  We brought our own sheet but it would be nice if there were already one on it.

I ordered the Hibachi Steak, and thoroughly enjoyed my meal along with the performance from my chef while he cooked it! This was a semi-formal restaurant, as they have dim lighting with a fairly expensive hibachi menu. The sushi however is always half-off and was extremely good. The crunchy roll was one of the best I''ve ever had. Beyond the food itself, the service was pretty good. Our waitress failed to notice us for awhile, and in return brought out two plates of edamame on the house to apologize. From there on it was great service. The presentation of the food was incredible. They cook your food right in front of you and even give you a show along with fairly large portion sizes that coincide with the expensive pricing of the hibachi meals. If you go here, the price greatly depends on what you order. If you go for hibachi it will be expensive, and if you go for sushi it will be a cheap comparatively to other sushi restaurants. I loved this restaurant and would highly recommend that anyone tries it! It''s very welcoming to dates, large groups, and even birthday or celebration dinners."

Santa Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You''re also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don''t feel like waiting. 

We were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  

The four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!

We started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  

For my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I''ve had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn''t even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I''d be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!

My friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn''t super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn''t eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I''ve seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.  

Overall, we loved the food and ambiance here-- a perfect ending to our trip! :)"

Maybe like 4 people ahead of us on the list you get to choose to be seated inside or out. We chose both. 20 mins later, we noticed the list filled up fast!

We had the shrimp tacos, crab cakes, and fried shrimp and onion ring platter. Everything was fresh, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. The tacos were my favorite and I wished I lived closer so I could have them more often!

We sat inside because it was freezing, but on a warmer day the view would be much better outside. Inside seating is bar style, but it''s still roomy and enjoyable.

The service was attentive and friendly and the prices were affordable. This is definitely going to be the place to go whenever we are visiting Santa Barbara

The only reason I didn''t give five stars is because the location is a bit small.  Still 100% worth it though!"

The PCH roll was somewhat dry, and while the tuna sashimi and Caterpillar roll were pretty decent I''ve still tasted better. Ironically, the most disappointing part of the meal was the tea that my parents and I ordered. It tasted like water; absolutely no flavor whatsoever. As my dad said, This green tea tastes like water, and not even good water! Although the prices are cheaper, I''ll probably hit up Arigato next time I''m in the mood for sushi just for the better quality."

This place is small and located at the end of the pier, parking can be a problem sometimes, but I guess you can valet it up front or wait it out. When you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them. I always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder; absolutely the best Ive had thus far. They also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well, apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits.

It''s already sweet enough so the honey isn''t necessary. I added peanut butter to mine for a protein kick and more flavor. I enjoyed the bowl itself, although it takes some work to get down to the actual acai base in the to-go cup. I would have liked a few more berries too. The granola itself is kind of meh... not bad but not great. For the price ($13 to $14 after tax and tip) I think the bowl should have been a little better. Again, don''t get me wrong, it was good overall. If you''re hungry and can put away a decent amount of food, you should be able to finish the large. Next time I would omit the goji berries because I''m not a huge fan of the flavor but wanted to give them another shot.

Everyone working there was pleasant, but service wasn''t spectacular. I don''t care too much about that as long as I don''t have to wait forever for my food to be ready. The place itself could have been a little cleaner... it wasn''t super messy but there were strawberry butts scattered on the floor near the chopping station and the fruity smell in the air seemed a little stale. (That''s just me being super picky and an OCD clean-freak... it''s probably totally acceptable based on normal people standards).

Overall, I wouldn''t be opposed to coming here again in the future. I might try the pb&j quinoa bowl because that sounds amazing! Nothing beats the acai bowls in Kirkland, WA though."

We sat at the sushi bar and our table was dirty and sticky. Next we ordered. I got a spicy tuna hand roll and as I look over to the chef who is making our sushi, I see him scooping the spicy tuna with his bare hands and packing it into the seaweed wrap. Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn''t eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off. We left and continued to walk around downtown santa barbara and no longer than 20 minutes after we left my stomach started to grumble and I felt faint. After running around frantically looking for a restroom I finally found one and puked up all the sushi that I ate. I would not reccomend eating here until it is inspected.."

This place is where you want to go if you want to celebrate something very special.

We went here to celebrate our 4th Year Annivervsary and my birthday on September 11, 2016.

It was perfect. My fiance told me we were going to an Authentic Japanese Restaurant and it was so perfect. 

$100 per person but it was worth it. 

Customer Service was PERFECT!

Food was PERFECT!"

Yummy, cheesy, meaty tacos, and they''re CHEAP! They also have tortas, liquados, AND vegetarian options. It''s also a really cute, warm atmosphere. Tacos al pastor is a winner (love the added fresh pineapple!), so are their potato tacos (a lot of places don''t seem to make these, but so glad these guys do!) 

The place is small and can get really crowded around lunchtime, but it''s also a very nice and warmly decorated dining room for a little taco place. I''d go here over Lily''s any day."
ZPWJAgvdHREomrUJ8tIh2Q,The Granada Theatre,1214 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,44,dN0g5tubyrAMvWTELOFRCA,2,"Went there last night for the Nutcracker ballet. The theatre decor is nice but performance was too amateurish. This is a classical ballet you do not need to bring vulgar break dance or other improper body movement in it to get cheap laughs from the audience. If I want to see that kind of stuff I guess I would go to another venue. In general the performance is lacking technical expertise. Only one or two members of the cast seem to know what ballet is. I get it, it is a possibility for students to show their talents and play along side professionals. But ballet is definitely not about stomping on the floor louder than the music. Also the acoustic qualities of the theater seem to be subpar. You just don''t get that classical music magic which the genius of Tchaikovsky has designed. They say that Nutcracker is the holiday tradition for Granada over the last so many years. Too bad they can''t execute their best dish properly."
34Eqv8jXgxg_EEwcsNgeeg,Backyard Bowls,331 Motor Way,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,659,k3hdSU8a2XPbUHSH2z8Uog,5,"This is a light yet very filling alternative to surrounding locations. And they''re accommodating to a paleo diet all you have to do is bring in your own additions or replacements - like almond/cashew butter. 

The prep area is wide open so you can watch while they make your bowl. They use very fresh ingredients that are cut up at order or minutes before.

Tip: This isn''t something I''d recommend you order on the go unless you eat it right away. It''ll lose some of it''s nutritional value if you don''t eat once received."

After a 45 minute wait, we finally got to our table outside. The view was amazing and although it was windy and a bit cold, the heaters above our table helped keep us comfortable. 

The Santa Barbara Shrimp Cocktail was just a standard shrimp cocktail, nothing spectacular. I had the crab sandwich, it was good but would have been better slightly warmer.

My husband had the rock crab special which came with a Caesar salad and clam chowder. The clam chowder was excellent. He usually adds pepper but said it came seasoned just the way he liked it.  The crab was great too, a great deal and very high quality.

Our son had the chicken strips, he ate 3 out of 4 of them, which means they must have been good!

We had a pitcher of Firestone, they actually have a very good selection of beers on tap as well as by the bottle.

The location is very casual, the inside consists of more bar like and stool seating. There are 4 actual tables outside with clear views of Santa Barbara.  The food is high quality and very much worth the price. Other than a long wait, it was a great experience."

The patio was really crowded, so we had to stand inside for our tasting, but the view was still very beautiful and relaxing.

The tasting was on par with the others in the area - a nice variety of wines and not expensive (I think it was $10 or $12). The last wine we tried, a luscious red blend, was my favorite of the day! 

They also allow pups on the patio and inside, which was great since we had ours with us for the day. We''ll be back next time we''re in SB!"

Once we viewed the property we knew that it was our reception venue. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful - every time we came for a meeting they offered us complimentary beverages including champagne and beer. When we were doing our walk through a few days before the wedding, Eli, the catering manager made some really great recommendations for improvements in design (table locations) and flow and we were very glad to utilize his expertise. The day of our wedding it was incredibly hot - luckily they have a/c - but Breanna came by multiple times to check on us to see if we were cool and comfortable. Because we purchased one of the wedding packages with a buffet style dinner, we weren''t able to taste our menu a head of time. However, the food was really good and they were very accommodating in substituting the vegetable on the menu.

We really loved that the Mansion has multiple rooms for dining, dancing and lounging, and that we had use of both indoor and outdoor spaces - which we used for lawn games and a cigar bar. Overall, the Mansion was more expensive than some of the other venues we were considering, but overall the benefits made up for the cost."

Of course my favorite was the rock crab. There was so much crab meat and it was buttery and sweet. It melted in my mouth. And the onion rings were battered to perfection. The chowder & bread bowl was warm and delicious. 

Can''t wait for another trip to SB to have lunch again!

It was very lively inside which made for a great atmosphere.

It was our servers first day but she did a very good job of serving us and giving us info on what we were drinking. Everything we drank was good!

I really wanted to like this place because the vibe is awesome and I love supporting local businesses, but their drip coffee is over-roasted and WAY too bitter. Hot, iced, it doesn''t matter. It''s all super bitter. I wanted to like it so bad that I had one of their baristas personally french press me a 16-oz cup of coffee hand-chosen based on my desired flavor profile. It took 10-15 minutes to make and cost me $6. It was terrible. So. Effing. Bitter.

To be clear, I''m specifically talking about their coffee in this review. Their lattes and cappuccinos look delicious, but I''ve never tried them. That''s not really my jam. So if you''re like me and just want a regular coffee, go somewhere else (Handlebar, SB Roasting Co.)."

$23 for the 3 pound crab special that came with clam chowder and a caesar salad. It was the tiniest 1.5 crabs ever. The first crab just had larger claws and a tiny body which means I pretty much paid for 2 huge crab claws. Barely any meat in the body. Second crab was the same thing just cut in half. But whatever meat I did have, it was fresh. I''ll give that to them.

Kind of disappointed after this so I went home and fried up my own 3 marinated crabs at $3.99 per pound. Totally made up for it."

We got the coconut shrimp which was ok...definitely over fried. We got the lobster tacos which were literally awful. Tasted like rubber on bitter cabbage with a squeeze of lemon...and the worst of it was that it was $18.95. To be honest the clam chowder was really good as well as their Arnold Palmer to drink and that's about it. Not worth the price or the wait at all for us.
