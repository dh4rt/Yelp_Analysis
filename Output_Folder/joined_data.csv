We have tried it multiple times, because I want to like it! I have been to it''s other locations in NJ and never had a bad experience. 

The food is good, but it takes a very long time to come out. The waitstaff is very young, but usually pleasant. We have just had too many experiences where we spent way too long waiting. We usually opt for another diner or restaurant on the weekends, in order to be done quicker."
gmjsEdUsKpj9Xxu6pdjH0g,The Voodoo Bone Lady Tours,"201 St Charles Ave, Ste 2560",New Orleans,LA,70170,359,6AxgBCNX_PNTOxmbRSwcKQ,5,"Loved this tour! I grabbed a groupon and the price was great. It was the perfect way to explore New Orleans for someone who''d never been there before and didn''t know a lot about the history of the city. Our tour guide had tons of interesting tidbits about the city, and I really enjoyed the experience. Highly recommended tour. I actually thought we were just going to tour through the cemetery, but she took us around the French Quarter for the first hour, and the cemetery for the second half of the tour. You''ll meet up in front of a grocery store (seems strange at first, but it''s not terribly hard to find, and it''ll give you a chance to get some water), and you''ll stop at a visitor center part way through the tour for a bathroom break if needed. This tour was one of my favorite parts of my trip!"

I wanted to get my engagement ring sized and was told over the phone that it could probably be done within the day. 
When I brought it by, the team confirmed that the jeweler would be able to accommodate my same-day request and that it would be around $40 (simple band, decrease by three full sizes).
I checked my size one more time, confirmed, and left to let them do their thing.
When I came to pick up later that afternoon, the ring was too small. It''s very important to note that Shalimar sized the ring perfectly, but that I made a mistake and should''ve gone up a half-size.
The Shalimar group were completely understanding and accommodating, even resizing my ring back up and getting it back to me within an hour at no charge! Even though it was my mistake!
The associates'' attitudes in dealing with what was a pretty embarrassing situation instantly earned my satisfaction and loyalty as a customer. Very grateful for such a wonderful experience."

All of their beers are very good, and I am also a fan of their burgers and tenderloins.  Therefore, I was excited to try their pizza, but I don''t think it ended up being on par with these other items.  My margherita pizza had a cracker-like crust and was pretty light overall.  The cheese was good, but none of the other toppings added much flavor.  There was no red sauce as is typical for a true margherita pizza.  My opinion is that Upland''s pizza might serve as a nice appetizer for a group, but I''ll be sticking with their burgers or tenderloins as my meal of choice on future visits."

As a 4 night guest at Hotel Palomar, the location of the restaurant is an obvious plus. The first night of my stay, I met a coworker in the restaurant for a cocktail. When we arrived, the host staff were busy and not available, so we just walked in. The restaurant was not too busy, so we just looked at a small table next to the bar and proceeded to take a seat. A waiter came by and I quickly asked if we could have a seat, before sitting down and told him we''d only be having cocktails. He stumbled on his reply, and in an irritated/in-convinced tone, told me I guess it would be fine and basically just kept walking mid sentence. My guest and I brushed it off, and started having a conversation while looking at the drink menu. To make a long story short, he was distant and we both got the couldn''t be bothered vibe from him. When it came to the bill, we asked if it could be split due to company transaction policies, and you would have thought asked him for some inconceivable task. We basically spent the rest of our night and elevator ride to our room in shock of the rudeness we had just experienced. 

Although that situation left a bad taste in our mouth, and the night before we decided to avoid the restaurant, we decided to grab another cocktail and give this place one more try. After looking around and ensuring last nights waiter wasn''t on shift, we walked over to the bar and started looking over the menu. Instantly, the bartender greeted us with pleasant small talk and made us feel 100% welcome. He asked about our day, recommended cocktails and was a completely genuine person. This guy (I think his name was Ben) is an absolute star! He gave us lessons on Whiskey, described how to make classic cocktails, and was 100% invested in our experience. This is exactly what a bartender at a 4/5 star establishment should be - actually he exceeds that. He was kind, funny, friendly and completely redeemed this restaurant/bar from our terrible experience the night before. 
I also ordered room service last night from this restaurant, and it was amazing. The bacon wrapped dates and chocolate cake are to die for! Great restaurant and amazing bartender(s). Too bad one bad egg could have spoiled this experience."

The burger was WAY overcooked (Especially when I ordered it Medium Rare) and the Seafood Jumbalaya was Decent.  Not worth the price.  There are better places to eat in the french quarter.

The reason I think she is so great is that she knows what will look best on me and over the past year has understood my limits for styles. I always go into the salon and tell her to cut my hair how she thinks will look best, and I always leave blown away at what she does. You know you have a great stylist when you don''t have to specify what you want done, but instead they see what needs to be done. Great stylist, great personality and very knowledgeable. I would highly recommend her to anyone who wants to look their best."

SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,2404,4zopEEPqfwm-c_FNpeHZYw,5,"We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you''re going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed."

I order a plain hamburger, and realized they put  bacon in it (which I am allergic to and unable to eat) after two bites. When I went back to the drive-through window to complain (didn''t realize the actual restaurant was open--it was almost 2 after all...), the guy took back the burger, said nothing, and disappeared. After 2 minutes of awkwardly making conversation with the next people in line in their car, he came back and rudely told me I had to go inside to get my food. Which I did. And still did not get an apology.

I refuse to go back there after that ordeal, which is a shame, because it''s nice to have a variety of places to go to after DT. Guess Freebirds it is!"

I love this place; it is clean, the staff are friendly and acommodating, and the service is fast.  The sushi is always delicious ((I''ve been here 3 times) and the prices are reasonable. In fact, this week my husband stopped in for take out, bought 4 sushi rolls and the total was $24.  That is amazing.

I had a combination dinner pad Thai and coconut soup. The soup was very tasty as I never had coconut soup before. The pad Thai was exactly what I was expecting and it did not disappoint. The restaurant had great Thai decor and music. The staff and service was top notch. For a town with not much selection for food, this was a great change of pace.

First two times I tried waiting in line, this time around we got smart and bought reserved seats so we could be on the benches. Well worth the extra $20 to not hassle with waiting in line for an hour. It goes toward the preservation of Jazz so it''s a good cause...just splurge.

The show was fantastic.  True musicians and great personalities to boot. I can only imagine that this is what concerts were like 50 years ago. The band members were dapper, engaging and insanely talented.  It''s in a tiny hole in the wall space that only holds maybe 200 people? So it''s very intimate and nice to see the smiles on the faces of the musicians as they share their craft with you. This is a must do while in NOLA!"

First time was mediocre, the second time was so very disappointing it beggars belief. I ordered some ribs and had to send them back because one half was warm and the other half was refrigerator cold. They came back and one side was really hot and the other side was still cold, third time it was edible. The manager came over the third time to apologize, never once offered to comp anything. I''m not the kind of guy to cause a fuss to get something comped, but to send something back three times to get it cooked properly and only get an insincere apology really pisses me off, enough for me to write this review."

At first glance of the menu, you may think you''ve never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you''re going to enjoy it. 

Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it''s worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they''ve got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you''re about to have.

Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you''re making this a boozy breakfast, don''t pass up on the michelada.

The ladies had the 7 oz. Tampa strip and the gents both had a 14 oz. ribeye. They grill their steaks over oak and citrus Wood and the smoky flavor is to die for! We are big fans of our smoker back home and cook our steaks this way as well, it''s rare to find steak cooked over woodsmoke in most places and this was worth the side trip!  Sides were veggies and sweet potatoes. The wines on offer were so reasonably priced- most under $20 a bottle but a decent selection. They just don''t mark them up 5x like most places! 

Our waitress Lisa also made great recommendations and her service was welcoming, friendly, and excellent. We are so glad we went local instead of to a chain. Bookmarking this place for a return trip next time I am in Tampa for sure!"

Although not touted as a Mexican destination they know how to rock the rock salt and pour that tequila.  They also just opened a wine bar a couple doors down for overflow and specialty bottles.  A high five for the on the rocks margaritas and house made white or red sangria - definitely worth the trip!

Need I say more? Yeah...you heard me. A doughssant! Worth the trip just to eat one of these!

Both couples decided to split a plate (you could tell the annoyed our server), and the food was good- but not worth the price for sure.
I will say the garlic bread they bring out before the meal was AH-MAZING! I could have probably eaten my weight in just the bread.

My other friend was still eating her dinner and they cleared her plate when she went to the restroom, after she told the waiter she was not finished. They did bring her a new meal in a doggie bag.

I was here for a conference, which seemed like an awesome idea. It wasn''t.  I''m in Direct Sales and (like most people at this conference) don''t have tons of extra money to spend on mediocre meals when I''m traveling.  $10 for a slice of generic pizza, small side salad and a soda for lunch.   I understand it''s a hotel but there weren''t any options close by.  Just getting your car from valet was a hassle and took a lot of time.  Being such a big property, it made getting to restaurants off the property really time intensive.  Since you''re so far out of Nashville (out near the airport), the good little holes you find when you''re in a city are pretty nonexistent.  

The property itself was great.  The hotel is HUGE but really pretty.  I enjoyed walking around but was really happy when I found what I didn''t know existed...a shortcut between my room and the Convention Center.  It took my 10-15 minute walk down to about 3 minutes!  BONUS!  Like I said, this place is ginormous.  

Room: Our room was great.  I shared a wonderful suite in the Garden Conservatory with 2 other girls.  We were under a group rate and my friend was quoted $200/night, which is awesome for the space we had.  We had a large room (probably used as a hospitality suite for groups) for socializing.  It had a great bar area set-up and a nice big fridge and lots of drawer space.  Our bedroom was separated by doors that could be locked from either side (like an adjoining room), so it looked like the hospitality suite could be reserved without reserving the room.  It was different than what I was expecting, but whatevs.  It was fine.  So, I wasn''t there at check-in.  The girl who reserved the room checked in a couple days earlier than my friend and I.  So, Sunday comes, and the bill was waiting for us when we woke up.  Our friend was charged $1200 for one room (I''m guessing the suite) and $1400 for the other room.  YEP.  She reserved what she thought was a 2 room suite for $200.  The bedroom door was closed when she got there and she asked them to open it up. It was all arranged by the bellman.  She was never told that the bedroom wasn''t included....kind of necessary if you''re staying over for 6 nights, dontcha think???  So, she''s being charged $2600 for what was supposed to be $1200.  Last I heard, the Gaylord''s legal department was investigating what she was told, what she wasn''t told and if they should charge her the entire amount.  

Checkout:  A FREAKING NIGHTMARE.  Between the money situation, which was not resolved as of late this week, and the 45 minute wait for a cart (in a hotel that holds thousands of people, you''d think they''d be plentiful and they aren''t) and a 25 minute wait for the car, my friend and I decided to sweat it out and schlep our goods to the door where our car would be delivered to us.  It was not a short walk and we had a TON of stuff, which meant multiple trips.  UGH.

I''m sure I''ll be back for another conference (I am pretty sure my company has booked this for at least one more year....) but I''m not going to be happy about it.  I might even consider driving down, staying in a hotel somewhere downtown and driving out to the Conference stuff."
cg4JFJcCxRTTMmcg9O9KtA,Ava,718 S Howard Ave,Tampa,FL,33606,544,kj5pjfid6pUP818rF0q6GQ,4,"This was my first time dining at Ava and I enjoyed most of it. We ordered the Ricotta cheese & toasted bread and although the flavor was excellent, I thought the bread to cheese ratio was off quite a bit. The ricotta came in a tiny ramekin typically reserved for flavored butters, so I expected more for an appetizer. 

The two pizzas split among a couple of people were the sausage and the potato with rosemary. They were both tasty but I think they forgot the Rosemary on ours. Still yummy, tho! Another entree was the grouper w/Israeli couscous. Scrumptious!

Dessert was a must and the zeppoles, or sugared donuts, were amazing. The cherry tart a little less so, but one person at our table loved it, so maybe it was just not my cup of tea. The cherries were a sort of candied cherry-interesting, but sweet with a very dense crust. Again, just not my personal fave. 

I will definitely return to try other menu items that looked great-like the pastas made in-house daily...that''s next!!"

One sandwich was messed up but it was very loud in there so I don''t think she heard me correctly but someone came to our table and had a new correct sandwich almost immediately.

The gator is in a sausage form. All chopped up into the gumbo. During this visit, I had to order their pasta. Chicken alfredo, for my 2 year old son. It was alright. The whole pasta tasted a bit dry.

In fact, I felt a little rushed.  All the locals were running in, saying hi to the owner and ordering up their usual''s.  No place for a rookie, but they were extremely patient with us and a few others that wandered in not knowing what they were doing either.

As soon as you cross the threshold, you know you have made a good choice, the smell makes your mouth water.  The Punk agreed so we decided to sit inside (everyone else was outside).

Typically, I would never ever order pastrami, but the menu said it was lean, so I tried something different for me.  Lean indeed.  Best pastrami I have had in a very long time.  In fact, maybe ever.  

The punk was amazed at all the bottle caps glued to every surface in the place.  It is a visual feast to keep you busy and entertained while you eat, if you choose to eat inside.  You cannot see the walls for all the nostalgic fodder.

I''m very happy with this location and the servers I have encountered so far have been helpful and pleasant.

The katsu is great and I highly recommend it to people looking for a more filling dish on the menu. The bao buns were also good for a lighter fish. I haven''t had anything I really regretted trying, but definitely ask your server about the portion sizes of each dish since they vary across the menu.

The cocktail selection is excellent. I even had a special Japanese Old Fashioned last time which was a little expensive, but well worth it for some quality Japanese whiskey. 

I''m looking forward to exploring the menu little by little. The best way to experience this is in a group setting so you can try more things and it really reminds me of Izakayas or Japanese pubs I visited in Japan and Korea."

The drinks were tasty and were served in very pretty glasses reminiscent of those some of our grandmothers had in their china cabinets. On the downside, all of the drinks seemed to have some combination of ginger, lime, and honey with the main difference being the kind of liquor you wanted in your drink.  So the choices felt limited.  I ordered the bacon wrapped dates, and have to admit that I was choking them down because I was hungry.  They tasted like they were double dipped in sugar.  Also, once another 10 or so people came in, it was very hard to hear each other because the noise level skyrocketed, which is surprising with so much fabric in the room.

We had two of their signature dishes -- the BBQ shrimp and bread pudding. This is a fantastic restaurant with great ambience and fantastic service. Highly recommend it if you're visiting New Orleans. Their fried green tomato appetizer was a great way to kick off the meal.

My only complaint is that you have to put your feet down if someone wants to pass by you on the aisle. The bartender at the little lounge next to the theaters is a delight. And being able to drink in the theater is a nice plus. The drawback comes with concessions. At a peak time on a Saturday, there were 5-6 employees at the counter but utter disorganization and no hustle whatsoever. The popcorn was also burnt. Next time I''ll eat beforehand and stick with the bar."

We sat at the bar and were greeted by a bartender who started by telling us they were out of most food items.  No worries, we just wanted a couple of beers.  We sampled several varieties, all of which were average.  Nothing memorable about any of the six styles we tried.

Unfortunately,  the staff was in a snit because their relief was late.  I get it, but they were having a full blown discussion behind the bar which all patrons could hear.  Kind of put a damper on things.

Cool location and cool place, but not sure we would go back based on this visit as there are better options near by."

One bartender didn''t even know there was a new cocktail menu.  The cocktail was weak and watery, and the liquors they have here and throughout Peppermill are the most unfortunate corporate types.  The service is also very spotty.  It confounded me how four bartenders could not seem to handle about 45 customers.  They didn''t have any bar areas, so they all floated around the circle, but then they''d stop, often just short of me and go to the waitress stations to fill their orders.  You can''t really build up any rapport with four bartenders floating around trying to serve everyone.  I also hated the people there.  Sorry, but many were your run-of-the-mill casino gamblers.  Why don''t you just sit at a machine and play?  You didn''t come here for the drinks or to smooze with the bartenders, so seriously, go sit at a machine.  One just sat next to me and lite up a cancer stick and the smoke just blew in my face.  Look, if I walk into a bar and sit next to someone, it''s their turf.  They can smoke, fart, vomit on themselves, if I don''t like it I can leave.  But if I''m there, it''s my turf.  Don''t come sit next to me and smoke, fart, or vomit all over yourself.  Or at least be frickin thoughtful and if you see your smoke wafting in my face, put your cancer stick and tray on the other side of the bar so it wafts in your face.  Oh, you don''t like smoke in your face???  Me neither moron.  Your life revovles around throwing away your pension money in a mindless electronic game of cards and killing yourself with carcinogens and toxins, well go kill yourself in private, seriously.  You don''t see me walking up to a bar and slitting my wrists and burning my money.  It''s gross.  I probably just realized this, but I really enjoy Cin Cin not only because they have the best cocktails in town, but they have no machines at the bar.  Peppermill, if you want to create a cool cocktail bar, ditch the machines, train your staff, or hire bartenders with better service skills, and buy some independent liquors."

I like the Han Dynasty here a lot more than the one in Olde City even if I give both 4*. Maybe I''m biased, because I love the service here. They''ve always been very nice, and came over to check in with me and just make some small conversation when they heard I had a peanut allergy (even though they had no peanuts in any of the dishes I ordered; I think it was Han''s sister?). I''ve been to this Han Dynasty more times in a month than the number of times I''ve been to the other.

Note though, that the different branches have different specialties. I heard the dan dan mian in Olde City is the best, but the one in UC isn''t so good (I wouldn''t know since it has peanuts). Overall, I think it;s okay food wise, still not spicy enough as with the other branch. But I like the layout and atmosphere a lot more.

Next, if you go during lunch, you can ask for lunch portions, that are smaller than the dinner portions, and half the menu price! So it''s a great lunch place too, alone, or in a group of 2 or 3."

i called in to ask about the 50% off for tulane students they were advertising, the woman assured me if i came with an id it would be half off and made an appointment for me, only once i got there did they tell me it''s only on certain days, it says it right on the sign, i was perturbed by the inconvenience and said so you''re not going to honor it even though you just made an appointment with me and told me it would be 50% off, they said no flat out at first even though the error was blatantly on their side, after my nagging, she eventually called john jay himself and he told the woman that he would not honor what i was told even though i had been inconvenienced by someone in HIS staff because it might cause a ''domino effect,'' i said how will there be a domino effect unless you continue to give people incorrect information, there will be no other ''dominoes'' as long as you remember what day it is from now on... they began to treat me somewhat patronizingly as i explained that usually businesses make concessions when they are the one at fault, that the customer is supposed to always be right, yadda yadda yadda, i left pretty upset and with ~45 minutes of my life having been wasted - empty handed but for a lame excuse from someone who owns at least 3 businesses over 10 dollars...

i have not received a haircut from them so if you''re one of those people who ONLY cares about the product and you think you''ll get a good cut go right on ahead, but if you''re like me (principled) and you don''t like handing profits to people who care nothing about their customers this is a good place to skip next time you need a cut"

We had already made hotel reservations and bought the concert tickets, so he just had to pay same-day price for airfare: all in all about $800 more. It was totally worth it, he later told me, Because I got to have the best sandwich of my entire life.

All because we randomly picked the Bricks of Ybor from Yelp. I can''t vouch for the peanut butter or meatless menu, but the meat sandwiches that we bought were absolutely phenomenal. I had the pulled pork, which was flavored with ponzu and served on Hawaiian sweet bread. It was one of the best meals I''ve had in a long time. We spent a few hours hanging out and drinking, during which time Brian, the owner, came out and talked to us, comped us a drink, let us try new appetizers he was developing (all for free) and generally made us feel really welcome. 

I kept my eyes open to the kind of crowd that came in and out of the restaurant. It seemed to draw everything from hipsters to geriatrics and strait-laced families with young kids. I think it speaks to both the diversity of the menu and the pleasant environment. We went back for drinks before and after the concert. It got very crowded but we still received excellent food, drinks and service. I give this restaurant my strongest recommendation, and it''s the first place I''m going when I next visit Tampa."

We had a problem where Monro Muffler underfilled our engine by 3 quarts of oil and caused damage to the engine. Monro''s insurance company said they would pay for damages if we brought to the dealer, we were frequent customers of Bergeys so we brought it here. They discovered the timing chain needed to be replaced, a chain that lasts the life of the car unless you don''t change the oil or have low oil pressure the tensioner can lock and stretch the chain. Joe the service associate that took the car in specifically said I told the insurance company as little as possible and told them he couldn''t tell if it was from the oil and there was no way to tell. And on top of that, was extremely rude and unprofessional to my wife bringing her to tears the way he spoke to her. My wife and I just bought a house in the area, only 26 years old and you lost a life long customer. Over the past year we spent about $7000 in repairs here, and Joe went out of his way to be unhelpful and leave us in a terrible spot. I brought it to another mechanic who was able to help us prove more it was from the oil and do what Joe told us and the insurance company they could not do. So on top of losing a service customer, I''m on the market for a new car and can tell you for sure where I will not be getting it."

It''s very vegetarian friendly!  The soft tofu is stewed and put into the dol sot pots which each and every stew feels like it''s custom made for you. 

You can select from beef, seafood or mixed meats (seafood & beef), mushroom, and just plain.  They can adjust the spice as needed too.  I always get the extra hot with the hot temperature, can''t beat it.  The rice also comes in a dol-sot which is great if you leave it in for a while, it burns the rice into a nice crispy shell.  DROOL.

Just thinking about this place makes my mouth salivate!  

If you''re not into tofu, they also offer korean bbq meats (cooked in the back), with other soup/stew items.

Love this place!!!"

The airport recently added several new restaurants with a local vibe and this is one of them. There isn't a ton of seating but it also isn't close to the TSA area so it's a bit hidden. Hey have TVs if you wanna catch a game while you wait for your flight. Food is very reasonably price for the portion size. Appetizers run from $5-$10 and majority of sandwiches are $12. I didn't order any food but it looked amazing! Drinks are tasty and Prices are not terrible. Think 22oz Jai Alai for $8.50. You cannot take alcoholic beverages into the terminal (Columbia does this I think). I had a Manhattan for $11 and it was very tasty. Staff is attentive and friendly.

In the past,  I was able to easily choose from a wide selection of food at reasonable prices any time of day. I have noticed recently that the produce is not as fresh, but more expensive,  and the prices of the organic foods are more expensive than Whole Foods. This morning I debated on going to Wegmans or going to this store. I only had to get a few items so I decided on this Giant since it was closer. Big mistake. I have seen on average at least 3 or 4 people shopping around 5 a.m. In the past but today just me. They had all of the store roped off where it was impossible to get to certain aisles and very difficult to get to the register. In my frustration I went under a rope to get soup.  I was then berated by a number of people who were supposed to be cleaning the floors but some were just standing around doing nothing. I couldn''t even walk out of the closest door because that was blocked off. If they needed to clean the floor they should have closed the store for a few hours. It would have taken less time at Wegmans which is where I will shop for now on."

My sister was visiting for the weekend, so I wanted to show her a solid night on the town that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. We started on Frenchmen, but for whatever reason it was dead. 
Deciding to adventure Uptown we proceeded on a respectable bar crawl, including Delachaise, Columns, and St. Joes, however, at 3 AM the usual Uptown culprits start to raise their heads. A summary of the following dialogue:

Friends Let''s go to FMs 
Me: No, too much broken glass
Friends: Let''s go to Snake and Jake''s
Me: Eh....
Friends: Brothers 3?
Me: I''m afraid I''ll hit my head on the ceiling
Friends: The Saint!!
Me: I suppose I haven''t been there before, I''m curious.

After entering the Saint the look on my sisters face was priceless, akin to a deer in headlights look. I kept my countenance, and we ordered a round. Things proceeded as expected ... unwanted dance grinding advances, check! uber drunk guy talking your ear off, check! Big Buck Hunter, CHECK!!! Overall I''m glad I moderately traumatized my sister and sated my curiosity in the same night. 

Helpful hint: They have outdoor seating, surprisingly, which is very good to escape the smoke"

Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature''s beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the wrong thing (cioppino). That wasn''t very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn''t ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I''ve had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier. It was free on a Monday late afternoon."

The portion was good for lunch and had good flavor.

For dinner I ordered the chicken satay to start and the Panang Curry with chicken for main course. I was very disappointed in the satay being that you only get two small skewers. The flavor and peanut dipping sauce were very good but they give a few more skewers.  The Panang was good and you get a good size portion of rice.

On a side note, I was disappointed they do not have Pad See Ew. Still some other options on the menu I will return to try.

We eat here every new years day, typically around 2 pm when we drag ourselves out of a drunken slumber to brave the bitter cold. They never have a problem seating our group of about 12-15 and are pleasant and quick service.

Called 4 time a to see how we could get our bill lowered, as we have been a loyal customer for 14 years. Nothing we can do was all I heard. We decided to no longer be raped by this company and set up service with Verizon. Called Comcast to cancel once we got hooked up with Verizon. All of a sudden, they can do better and reduce my bill to 140.00 a month....which I would have been extremely happy with. Unfortunately, it should have been offered the four previous times I called.  I have Verizon now and have been quite happy with the installation, customer service, and overall product.  I wish Comcast would go under because they don''t care about quality customer service. They could offer me a years free of service, yet I wouldn''t take it on principle. Screw you Comcast!"

HTqoEYWlJkEXNEmHtKCPIA,Stitch-It Alterations,4101 Hillsboro Cir,Nashville,TN,37215,25,KLxHEsW1beqLqyrrNUuRqg,5,"This review is LONG overdue!  I visited Stitch-It in June 2013

In brief: Stitch it did an EXCELLENT job on my dress and I was extremely pleased.  I needed it done in a rush and they were able to accommodate me.  Given the tight turnaround, and the work that needed to be done, I didn''t mind paying a premium.  The service and results far exceeded my expectations.

Complete Experience: I was attending a convention in Nashville, TN and had ordered an evening gown online a week before (admitted procrastinator tendencies).  The gown was a navy blue Tadashi Shoji evening gown with sequins and an intricately designed lace and sheer layered bodice. The gown was a tad bit too long and there was a bulge in the back. The dress arrived a few days before I was scheduled to fly out to Nashville and I knew I wouldn''t have time to get it tailored before leaving.  I found a few Nashville area tailor shops on Yelp, read the reviews and decided I might try Stitch-It.  I also saw a few cleaners that advertised they performed tailoring services, but they (quite frankly) didn''t give me the warm and fuzzies.  

Stitch-It was about a 30 minute drive from the Gaylord Hotel where I was staying, so before taking a taxi that far, I decided to check with the hotel to see if they had an in-house tailor.  When I took the dress to the Gaylord tailor/seamstress (who was the nicest lady ever), she looked at the gown and said I can hem the bottom....I''d have to do it by hand.  The top part though....I won''t touch that with a 10ft. pole!  I laughed, but appreciated her honesty in not being able to handle the work that I needed done.  

I contacted Stitch-It and sent pictures of the dress via text message to a nice young man who''s name I can''t remember (I think it was Cameron...I could be wrong).  They assured me that they should be able to accommodate me, so I hopped a cab and visited Stitch-It.  When I arrived I was greeted by courteous and professional staff.  I was shown to the dressing room and changed into my gown.  My personal tailor was Maggie O''Neill and she was AWESOME!  After the fitting and pinning, I left the gown and picked it up in two days.  It fit perfectly and was well worth the fee.  If I lived in Nashville, I would DEFINITELY use Stitch-It on a regular basis."

My boyfriend and I had brunch here on Sunday, and we loved it! We both started with the Brandy Milk Punch, which was divine.  If you are of age, order this drink!  It is an alcoholic milkshake, and I could literally go here just to drink that because it is so good.  

They bring out fresh bread and butter, and then my boyfriend and I ordered the trio of appetizers.  The trio is quite small, but it includes a duck springroll, fried chicken livers and a fried oyster.  The duck springroll came with a wonderful tangy sauce, which I greatly enjoyed.  My boyfriend enjoyed the fried chicken livers and the fried oyster, but those are not two of my favorite things.

For my entree, I ordered the shrimp and grits.  Oh my goodness... so good! The shrimp are bacon-wrapped, and the grits are true Southern grits.  I will definitely order this dish again when I get the chance to return.  My boyfriend ordered the fish of the day, which was blackened Mahi Mahi, and he loved it.

It''s not a genre I ever eat unless I''m forced to on a road trip.  However, I am from Buffalo, NY, and am a chicken-finger connoisseur, so I decided to give this place a chance.  Additionally, it was on a road trip of sorts.  We had been at the beach all day and were halfway back home to central Tampa.

The service is amazing!  I have never seen fast-food workers who take so much pride in their jobs.  These people were drinking the Zaxby''s cool-aid!  They seemed more like Disney employees than fast-food workers.  Both a female counter gal and a male (possible the manager/franchisee) went out of their way to make sure we liked everything.  

The food was a solid 4 stars, but my review overall is rounded up for the above mentioned points.  We had the chicken finger sandwiches on Texas toast.  While the chicken fingers themselves were super juicy and moist, the Texas toast was too greasy to eat them on.  I love sauce and enjoyed the variety.  We tried the Zax, hot honey mustard, insane hot and ranch.  What is missing from the sauce variety, for me, is a spicy bbq and blue cheese.  Serving ranch with hot sauce is an insult to the folks in Buffalo that created the cuisine.  Aside from the bread and sauce small issues, I really enjoyed our meal.  Additionally, it was so cheap!!  $12 and change for 2 meals with drinks.  

I am a fan!  This place doesn''t quite hit all the marks of Buffalo-Inspired food, but it does a pretty good job of putting a southern twist on chicken fingers!"

Wow... I was not disappointed!
We started out with the crab cake appetizer- it was very well portioned (2 large crab cakes) and the sauce with it had an interesting hint of dill (just lovely and refreshing and a little different).
We were feeling like comfort food and had the chicken tenders-  The portions were very generous and the food was just solid.  Not fussy or stuffy or trying hard... just good, wholesome and good to eat.
The service was fine- however there is only one waitress for the tables and the bar, so i can imagine that if it is full that would cause some delays.  Overall it was just a lovely meal and the prices were unbelievably reasonable (most places have crabcakes 1/2 that size for twice that price)...

ZpXZgnBrNodHH8pKpOK_Kg,Jesse's Steak and Seafood,524 W Brandon Blvd,Brandon,FL,33511,267,fFX81fVi2KpnlR7CN7ht_A,4,"My boyfriend and I both decided to try Jesse''s for the first time after we''d both grown up in the Brandon area and neither of us had ever been, and really hadn''t heard much about the restaurant. 

We dined on a Saturday night and even though the parking lot and restaurant was packed, we were sat right away at a 2-top next to a window facing SR-60. 

Our server, Nikki, greeted us in a reasonable amount of time. We ordered our beverages and she brought them shortly after that. Something I did not like was there was not a drink menu on the table, but Nikki was able to tell us what beers were on draft and non-alcoholic drinks. She took our appetizer and entree order all at once. 

We ordered crab stuffed mushrooms and a French onion soup to share. These items came out together. The crab stuffed mushroom was basically a giant thing of crab stuffing on a TINY mushroom, which was almost laughable, but had a good flavor nonetheless. The French onion soup had a great flavor and wasn''t scalding hot, which was super nice to eat right away. 

After our appetizer came out and we finished it, our Caesar salads came out as well as a loaf of bread and some butter. This was also really great pacing of our meal! Nikki never let empty plates sit on our table, was very attentive, and always made sure we had drinks in front of us. The Caesar salads were good. I gave the bread two chances... once dipped in the French onion soup and once just with butter on it... the bread could have definitely been better - it just didn''t have a good flavor to it. 

I ordered the 6 oz filet and he ordered the 16 oz Delmonico - both cooked medium rare. The steaks are served with sautéed mushrooms, your choice of side, and a salad or soup of the day, which isn''t mentioned anywhere on the menu. I got broccoli as my side and my boyfriend got a sweet potato with all the fixings. I saw three tables sat after us receive their entrees before us - I don''t know if it was a kitchen issue or something else, but we were sat at least five minutes before each of those tables - I tried to make sense of the delay, but it honestly wasn''t a big deal to me. Our steaks came out on hot metal plates that were inserted into a cooler outer shell. My filet was nice and thick and cooked perfectly and the broccoli was steamed very tenderly, but there were not enough sautéed mushrooms on the plate, in my opinion. If I had known it would have been like five mushrooms with the steak, I totally would have gotten them as a side. My boyfriend''s steak was cooked perfectly as well, but being on the hot metal dish led the steak to cook more at the table, which he wasn''t particularly pleased with. He enjoyed his sweet potato with butter, but it didn''t come out with cinnamon on it like he requested. 

Anyway, I am sure we will return! Our server, Nikki, was fabulous. She was extremely attentive, had a great attitude, and was knowledgeable!"

Their stage is really cool! Raised up, lights that move around, good sound system, a fog machine, and a pretty big dance floor. 


But their food service.... crappy both times Ive been there. 

The last time I was there I walked in, hadn''t been greeted by anyone at the empty front podium, and just found a table. I figured once I sat down Id wait for an employee to get back to the menus and go up and ask for one. So I saw a lady working up at the front and went up and asked her.  She said that they stopped serving food at...... I cant remember if it was 9 or 10 pm.... but she gave me a certain time that the kitchen closed. I went back to my table and looked at the time. It was 10 minutes before the time she told me the kitchen closed. I thought that was kinda dumb, but oh well.... maybe they stopped taking orders 10 minutes ahead or something. The next thing I see the SAME EXACT LADY seat four people RIGHT NEXT to our table and give them menus. Then she takes their order, and brings out their food. All I wanted were some freakin french fries and I had to sit there and watch the people who got there long after me eating french fries instead. RUDE!"
2oij3AB1we03O7_H29iJ9g,Cured Nails,813 Gallatin Ave,Nashville,TN,37206,71,jOpJBXl6goiRYvsS8Oeriw,5,"Would it be weird if I wanted to move in and permanently live here!? The style of this salon is impeccable. The color palette and decor they chose makes it feel like you''re in a Restoration Hardware magazine...in France...surrounded by heirloom antiques. I didn''t know what to expect when arriving but I was pleasantly surprised with their upscale polish options like Chanel and many others I actually didn''t know I needed in my life until I arrived. 
Service was prompt and I especially enjoyed the extended massage. Most importantly the tools she used were brand new/ had been sterilized. I watched her open the fresh package up, that made me feel good about cleanliness and safety. I don''t know if all nail salons have cute gold tips on their nail trimmer tools but now I want them for my own collection. 

I picked a gray color for my toes and did OPI Funny Bunny gel on my nails. So far I''m loving both! 
So nice to see a high end nail salon finally making its way to Nashville. I''ve gone to others in Nashville that seem to be high end, but it just ends up like a VIP club on the Vegas strip with loud music and sparkles just waiting for a Justin Bieber song to come on. 
CURED was not only high end, but it was classic. Like The Hamptons type of classic but with a comfortable low key brunch with girlfriends mimosa type of vibe. I think it would be amazing for a bridal party with so many photo opportunities. I felt comfortable with their prices, competitive to anywhere else I''ve gone in Nashville worth mentioning. 

I didn''t know where to park so I parked on the side in a random parking lot. Looks like there''s a lot of up and coming businesses beside them under construction. So I''m assuming once those are complete, parking will be pretty straight forward? 

When my Mom & Sister come into town next I''m going to take them here & go to Local Honey for lunch since it''s so close. 

Can''t wait to go back. Welcome to the neighborhood!"

The lady that did virtual survey was very meticulous and professional and we screened through the whole apartment in 15 minutes. No one contacted me after that, so I sent a second email almost a month after, on 06/05 asking if everything is ok, and if I can get the quote. I don''t need to mention that other 4 companies sent their quotes in less than 48 hours. Since no one replied til today, I called the direct phone and I left the message on the answering machine. No one called me back. I hope everything is ok, and that no one is hurt, because I don''t see any other reasonable explanation why they are avoiding me. Very, very unprofessional."

It is always clean and the staff is always friendly. the reason I am giving them for star in that V is because they haven''t done some of the necessary updates that other theaters have done by updating the seating offering wait staff service excetera. You can go to the Roadhouse theater for $11 with a student discount or 12 bucks, which is all required liners and heated seats and they have wait staff with a chef. The pricing is nearly the same at this theater but it doesn''t have all the same perks.

first of all, there are vegetarian options on the menu. we started with the veggie spring rolls which were hot, crisp, and delicious. my husband had the duck and rice vermicelli soup which we both agreed was great in a yummy, savory broth. i had the beef pho which i didn''t care for because the meat was a bit grisly and i''m not a fan of tripe. i''ve not eaten a lot of pho and wasn''t sure what to order, though. they offer several different beef cuts and i should have picked a different one. next time. also, the regular serving size was way more than enough. i don''t think either of us could have come close to finishing the largest bowls.

My roommate and I were craving sushi and were recommended to come here by Yelp and a friend so we decided to give it a shot. 

First off, they get bonus points for serving FREE edemame as an appetizer. I usually pay $4 to $5 for it at other sushi restaurants. The mango sake drink I have was alright, but not worth the price I paid for it. 

On to the main event...SUSHI! We had the philly roll, tempura roll, tuna roll, and california roll. They were all yummy, but I would have to say I have had better. Actually, out of the hand-full of sushi restaurants I have tried, this was the worst sushi I have tried, but I cannot say the sushi was bad by any means. Don''t get me wrong, it was still tasty. 

The other big thing was that the rolls were actually falling apart. I have never had this happen. Therefore, I can say that the presentation and the ability to get the sushi from the plate to my mouth without falling apart did make me unhappy. 

I am willing to come back to Nippon Tei, but I have to say I already have my other favorites. The prices were average compared to other sushi bars, so that won''t really help them out either when it comes to bringing me back. We will see!"

Buying the tickets was a breeze, and the atmosphere was inviting.  Found the comfortable seats with no problem and ordered right away before the movie began.  I ordered pretzel sticks - food was hot, prompt & delicious.  I was excited for the movie to begin.  Once the advertisements were done and the movie started, that''s when I noticed something wasn''t right.  The entire screen was so dark that I was not able to make out the faces of the actors on the screen.  I kept lifting up the 3D glasses to see if it made a difference - nope.  The two people seated next to me were noticing the same and complaining.  I thought that maybe this is how the movie was filmed?  Then it got worse.  Even with the 3D glasses on, the shadows in the background on the screen were double and there was no discerning most actors'' faces at all.  I got up and went to the lobby and asked for the manager.  The gentleman wore a blue shirt, middle age with a beard, said that this was the 3D experience, it was a closed-system and there was nothing he could do.  I simply asked him to come with me into the theater to see with his own eyes how dark it was.  He would not and did not.  I suspect this wasn''t the first time he''s heard this from a customer.  I''ve seen normal movies at this location before, but this was my first, and last experience with their 3D in room #1."

Being born and raise in Santa Barbara, actually just down the street, I have been coming here for some years now. I''ve tried probably over half of their sandwiches and all have been good, so good it''s hard to pick a favorite.  In addition, I cannot forget to mention their awesome soda selection, so awesome I cannot hesitate to try something different with every visit. You won''t find anything super fancy or exotic, like a roasted duck pastrami sandwich here, but if you''re a local or just passing through and feel like having a great sandwich with good fresh ingredients swing by Plaza Deli and grab a bite."

My friends were drawn in by the awesome looking burger they had, and indeed the burgers were all they hoped for. It came with a generous portion of crispy fries. But if you want anything else besides the $17 burgers, expect to spend over $30 for your entree. While the ambience feels and looks casual, it is fine dining.

Unfortunately, the waiter did sell the shrimp and grits with the additional crab as heaven in his mouth, but that it was not. I''ve had better shrimp and grits in Atlanta, and there is no reasonable way you should be paying $30 for shrimp and GRITS. Without the crab, it was still over $20.

But everything else was great. Drinks were delicious. Everything came out pretty quickly. Oh, when we mentioned we were visiting from out of town, the waiter was nice enough to give us a complimentary appetizer of the cool pizza to start. It was great but the name is hard to say or remember. And the rabbit and chicken liver pate was super worth since it comes in a huge mason jar.

I recommend sticking to the drinks, appetizers, and burgers and you''ll be a pretty happy camper."

They were very friendly and even though they didn''t have 4 pedicurists on the schedule that day they added one to accommodate us. That was really nice of them as they could have easily told us no. 

The place itself is decorated very modern and offers a very clean, minimalist atmosphere. Upon walking in we were immediately greeted and after we checked in with the front desk we were asked what we wanted to drink. They had complimentary mimosas, wine and champagne, the perfect way to begin to unwind. Once we picked out our polish colors we were well on our way to getting our pedicures. Everyone was so nice and made us feel comfortable and welcomed. My polish never chipped the whole time I had it on. I will definitely be back. 

The only downside is that its street parking only, which isn''t something that they can control. They told us most of their business comes from people who work in the CBD so parking probably isn''t an issue for their regular customers. Aside from parking being an issue I would definitely go to Buff again."

I visited on 3/8/13 and got their Mini Manicure- it''s only $15!  I chose an OPI polish and the nail technician did a GREAT job!  So great in fact, that today on Monday, 3/18/13- I did not have ONE CHIP!  This is amazing for polish!  My nails looked fabulous!  The technician was friendly, as were the other stylists.  I''m not sure if it was the manager or the owner that was working the front desk- but she came over as well and was super friendly and welcoming.  The salon looks amazing, trendy, and peaceful.  It has a great vibe.

I was so happy with my first appointment- that I went back today, and left disappointed.  I went to the same nail techinician- and we talked as she worked on my nails.  The person working the front desk (seemed like an owner/ manager- although different from my first visit) was SO  nice, welcoming, and talkative.  This time though I needed a gel manicure, in french- as I am in a wedding this weekend.  I explained that I was in the wedding, assuming the technician would know that this more special than just an everyday manicure  The technician stated after she started my nails, that she did not have the proper brush that she needed in order to do the manicure.  So like most places- they paint the white, and then go back later with a brush to create the crisp, perfect line.  Since she did not have the brush to do that- she used a q- tip.  So obviously the lines are not perfect or even.  Along with the lines being uneven- some are thicker than others, and the edges go up, instead of down.  My nails are not at all filed and shaped pretty either.  For $40 (+ a tip)- I really expect them to look right.  I went during my lunch hour, and it was supposed to be 30 minute appointment, but the appointment took a little bit over an hour.  I understand that french takes a little extra time- but this seemed like quite a bit extra.  I was late for work, and had to hurry out of there when she was finished and did not want to be even more late to work to stay there to make a complaint.  I wish I would have- but I also felt bad because the technician was trying so hard- but they are just not up to par.

I''m conflicted, but I don''t know that I''ll return.  I loved it to so much the first time, I even sent friends over there.  But after this time- I am not happy with the product.  I wish it wasn''t gel- because I can''t even take the polish off myself.  So I''m forced to have nails that I am unhappy with, or go to somewhere else and pay to have this taken off, and then pay to have them re done- all before a 6am flight on Wednesday morning, and it''s Monday afternoon...."

We decided for our date night we would give it a try on Saturday. We pulled up about 8pm and the open sign was turned off. We thought maybe the light was burnt out or someone just forgot to plug it in. So we proceeded to the door. There were people inside and the sign said open till 11pm, so we walked inside. It was like walking into the Twlight Zone, everyone stopped and stared at us. The woman behind the bar came over and told us they were closed. HUH! Ok.... so we left.

We ordered and the food took a fair amount of time, understandable because of such a large party. Problem was, when the food came out, no server knew what we''d individually ordered, so it became a huge mix up with people eating others'' food. 
I ordered the pork belly tacos which had a great caramelization on the outside and tender inside. I also ordered the spicy beef pho, which was perfectly balanced with flavor after adding the accompanying bean sprouts and limes.

*Pass - crab salad sandwich (lacked flavor, mayo was overpowering, crab flavor was almost non-existent, side of onion rings too greasy) - would not order again

Is it worth a visit? Yes, but be selective of what you order as the menu tends to be a hit and miss."

Our salesman was friendly and helpful.  Once the negotiations began however, our salesman left the picture and we were left to deal with the manager.  This experience was annoying.  I had done my research and shopped around.  The manager must not be accustomed to dealing with informed shoppers because he was obviously lying to me on a number of fronts.  Had my wife not needed the car immediately - and wanted a color that was only available this dealer - I would have moved on to another dealership.  

My advice would be that if you have to come here be armed with knowledge and info on pricing from other dealers but in general I would probably buy from a different dealer if I had to do it over."

The pool is small but no one was there the two times I went to use the hot tub.

Here in Santa Barbara, it does not get any fresher. Right from the fish tank in the cooking pot on your plate. Don''t expect a fancy restaurant with a nice ambiance because this is not the reason you come here (though the outside seating has a nice ocean/harbor view).

but 3.5 could''ve been 4 if it wasn''t so expensive for what i''m getting. and if the kitchen was more accommodating.

the first time i ever ate there, (around when it first opened), i ordered ravioli and received 3 or 5 pieces for $11-13.  another time i visited, i tried substituting a salad for fries with my burger. and my server said, no, sorry, the kitchen won''t do that. 

are you $^%ER@# kidding me??? it wasn''t a super modification. it''s not as if i asked for a burger with only one bun, no tomato, half piece of lettuce, two onion rings, and love. it wasn''t like i wanted to substitute lobster for fries!!! needless to say, this is the first time i''ve been unable to substitute. i''m usually really easy to please, but this is the first time i''ve ever felt difficult. at least in my head. is this in my head?

The staff seemed shocked about our 6 pm arrival, and sanitized a large table for us quickly. Yes, the table smelled like dirty sanitized rags, ugh, but, once you got buzzed on...I mean beyond, the smell, your waiter will appear and take your drink orders. 

We got beers and margaritas. The margarita drinker in the group declared that it was good.  The prices for drinks weren''t that bad.  ($2.95 for Mexican beers). 

We all ordered our food, which was brought out at a good time, fresh, and hot. Everyone snarfed - it was good and tasty and all our needs were met attentively by the quiet waiter. 

All of us were let satisfied, and our specific requests (i.e. no beans light on the cheese) were met by the kitchen staff with no problems. We left with full bellies then went to the Red Garter for a mind-numbing strip club experience. 

What a way to wrap up a review..

El Arado has gotten a bad wrap - but, the staff is decent, the food wasn''t too shabby and the drink prices are cheap. A good place to start out for affordable and filling eats before a night out in Fountain Square (or to strip clubs)."

The bar is great, the staff friendly, but there is not a dish I have tried that is passable (although the asian shrimp wasn''t bad, but very sweet). First visit we wrote off as a new restaurant working out the bugs. On our second visit I ordered a turkey burger and received a dry turkey patty. No one informed me that they were out of buns, but they could have at least tried to dress it up. It was seriously a lone piece of ground meat (to their credit, the manager did comp that meal). Today we received fish and chips that had to come out of a box and chicken salad that could have greased my axles!

They are truly outstanding, not greasy and finished with paresan cheese. The metaphorical cherry-on-top was the chocolate milkshake (which actually had no cherry on top).

The rooms have the essentials. The beds are quite comfortable.

Cons
Hallways are a bit shaggy. NBD since I am not staying in the hallway.

By far the worst pizza I''ve had. Thin crust was not crunchy, olives were junk and salad was $6 for bad strands of lettuce and minimal cheese which looked horribly powdered. It came in a prepacked divider. Rip off. Not worth more than a dollar. 

Their knots were ok, and extremely unhealthy, but rest was crap.

I normally don''t order from them or anyone else but good pizza like Grimaldi''s, BJs or Mellow Mushroom but I hadn''t gone grocery shopping and normally stock up on organic pizza from Publix or whole foods which btw is cheaper and tastier. But, this was the only place opened late. 

I never want dominoes again. It''s just a reminder that corporate chains need to fall and get out the way. I rather pay for quality. Not preservatives and poison.

My husband and I walked in without reservations during their Sunday Jazz Brunch. We waited about 40 minutes, but we had the music and ambience to keep us occupied. 

Despite the place being ridiculously busy, our server didn''t rush us at all. He encouraged us to take our time browsing the menu and placing our orders- definitely one of the friendliest servers I''ve encountered. 

The food here was absolutely amazing! The complimentary bread and butter was very nice. My husband and I started off with the seafood gumbo, and it was delicious! Both of us had a sea bass entree and it was definitely the best fish I''ve ever had. The fish came with a side of green beans and this DELICIOUS sauce that could make anything taste great. We finished off with chocolate orange ice cream and creme brûlée for dessert. The next table over was raving about their bread pudding, so I''m guessing dessert is usually a hit all around at this place. 

The coolest bit about my experience here was that my husband and I got seated where Ronald Reagan sat on his two visits to Mr. B''s (far left corner)- Reagan just so happened to visit on my birthday! 

Our bill came out to be $100+ but it was worth every penny. If I''m in NOLA again, I''m definitely revisiting Mr. B''s."

The margarita was great. I had the cilantro chicken enchiladas. Also great! The outdoor seating area was very pleasant under the umbrellas on a lovely Saturday afternoon. 

Overall, I liked it. They just need a bit more time to figure out the flow. I''m thrilled to see something affordable move into my neighborhood. The prices are very reasonable and this place isn''t trying to be casual fancy like the last two train wrecks that occupied this space.

   Nonetheless, we had a great meal. 
    Service was spot on. Professional but not overbearing or obvious. 
    A little disappointed that they were out of two ingredients for one of their signature cocktails, but it WAS the day before Mardi Gras.
   The bread and butter at the table was excellent. Crunchy outside, soft inside.
   The beets salad was so much better and different from similarly named items at other restaurants. The greens literally tasted like they had been picked from a sun warmed field minutes before.
    G''s Choucroute was a meaty fiesta. He loved it. My crab ravioli was lovely with a delicate Meyer lemon sauce. 
    Bread pudding for dessert was just how we like it - sans raisins.

The one place you never cut corners is in the food, and that''s exactly what they did. 2 of the 3 salsas were so watery that you didn''t get any tomatillo or tomato on your chip, at all. The third salsa, the pics de gallo, was the worst chop job I''ve ever seen in a restaurant. Huge pieces of Serrano pepper with varying sizes of everything else, and in stark contrast to the other 2, completely dried out. 

Without even looking at the menu, I know what I want... #15. That decision hasn''t changed for over 10 years. Today I should have made a different choice. I''m not sure if they recently went thru a purveyor change but the quality of everything on the plate was horrible. 

I used to love the rice, it changed. I used to love the chicken quesadilla, now it''s flavorless and covered in 2 lbs of cheese for 1/2 a breast.

Please go back to your old ways and cut costs elsewhere, other than the food."

I have a bad back (bulging and hemorrhaged discs) and sometimes I can''t sit in the same place for long periods of time. Eddie was very helpful and accommodating with that. While I was there I talked to pretty much every employee there. The entire staff are really friendly. It''s a cool place to be. I did a Yelp check-in and got $10 off! How cool is that?! On the website I saw that the owner, Chino developed his own tattoo ointment. He said that he just wasn''t very happy with the other stuff that''s out there because they are petroleum product so he did a ton of research and developed his own.

I can only speak for the manicure/pedicure aspect because I did not get a massage. Typically, you go to a spa to escape and relax - you can not do that here. It is small, dirty, and the staff is terrible. 

I walked in and the receptionist was on the phone - he did acknowledge that I was standing there, but several staff walked by and did not offer to assist. Finally, after two other guests came in behind me, someone came up and took me back - just to get me out of the way. Asked what my name was and left. Did not offer me water/refreshments of any kind. I''ve had better reception at the local nail salon. Then I had to wait for 10-15 minutes for my technician to finish up her current client, which I didn''t mind because I leisurely picked out my color. When it was my turn, the nail technician was shaky and rushed. She cut my cuticle and I bled. She was sick and kept blowing her nose into her shirt (gross!!) and took time outs to really blow/dig in her nose with a tissue right in front of me! Lady, you are touching my hands with yours, you are blowing bacteria into the air, if you are that sick don''t come to work - *Management, if your employee is that sick do not make them come in! You will lose clients. 

She gave me the worst hand/arm massage I have ever had (that is usually everyone''s favorite part, and the technician''s opportunity to shine!). No pressure was applied, and she just basically rubbed lotion into my skin and made a snarky comment about how my skin was so dry is was just drinking up all the lotion. Yes, I realize it''s dry, probably due to the 20 degree weather and wind outside, but thank you for making me feel self-conscious. 

When I went to leave the receptionist was on the phone again, but did actually put them on hold to get me out of there. I opted to put everything on my room charge, which resulted in extra fees but I didn''t care. There was a blaring sign saying how they preferred cash gratuity and that there would be extra fees associated with putting services on your room. Yes, everyone prefers cash gratuity - but how tacky can you be?!! 

Overall, it was an extremely disappointing experience. I have been wanting to stay at the Monteleone for years and made it a priority to experience their salon. My gel nail polish is already chipping and it hasn''t even been a week. Spa Aria definitely needs a overhaul and I would recommend you go anywhere else but here."

It was completely dry rotted on the backside and the tire shop ended up replacing both front tires for $450.

My parents always request Oana and she is an awesome server-- answers questions, gives suggestions, and really knows the menu. We were quoted an hour wait, but were able to grab a high top in the bar area with no wait (they are full service).

Spasso is Italian, but has its own little spin; it''s not just the classic dishes of a typical Italian restaurant.

They start you off with bread and this delicious eggplant/pepper topping that is so refreshing. I typically love oil for bread, but love this alternative.

I started with a Caesar salad which was perfect; just enough dressing, super fresh and I love the shaved Parmesan on top. For dinner I had pappardelle porcini which I think is the best item on the menu, it is thick pasta with sundried tomatoes, mushrooms and chicken with light sauce. It is totally delicious, and I had leftovers to have for lunch the next day.

Spasso is definitely recommended for a great dinner in Media!"

No matter the time of day, it seems to get pretty rowdy and my friends and I have had drinks spilled on us on multiple occasions. Almost every time I have been here with my fiancé or friends, it has taken an abnormally long time to get service whether it be inside, outside at a table or bar. The food is mediocre for the price and a few times the food took MUCH longer to come out than what we were told, and when asking management what was going on, we were told that the estimate was wrong and it was too bad. Staff is rude and far from attentive, though it seems like this place is always over-staffed when we have been here. Amazes me that management allows such a huge lack in customer service. No longer wasting our time and money here, and we advise our friends and family to do the same. It is too much of a hit-and-miss to come here and attempt to have a good time."

Naan is soft. Garlic is tasty but I usually like the original best.  Regardless of your entree of choice, you really cannot go wrong. And although it does not appeal to my level of spiciness preferred (I like it HOT HOT HOT), it has great flavor and is great for the average spicey food eater.

Perhaps too hip for many over 35 but if you can tolerate the boisterous and extremely casually attired youth--I haven''t worn a suit in 20 years either but even 20 year olds should have something besides skinny jeans and T-shirts with borderline obscene slogans in their closets--the food is worth it and the staff copes well.   

I had a 6:00 reservation (obtained the day before) but the sky seemed threatening a downpour so I came early to avoid it and was seated 20 minutes or so before the appointed time.  I often don''t even make reservations and have no trouble getting seated at popular places by being there when they open or, for those open all day, coming before the popular dinner hour, but that didn''t work the day before at Lüke.  Even at 4:30 the place was packed so I did make one for the following day.

My meal started with the crispy Brussel Sprouts.  Even if you hate Brussels sprouts (I like them), don''t be afraid to try this dish--if no one told you you might not know what you were eating.  They are in some sort of sweet/sour sauce/dressing and fried both slightly blackened and crispy as advertised . . . tossed with almond slices, small bits of jalapeño and sprinkled with shavings of cheese on top.

Then I had pork schnitzel and pommes frites (that''s shoestring fries to the Galliphobes).  It came with whitish gravy in a pitcher, I suppose to make it Southern.  The gravy was good but I skipped eating it, doing that the usual way with a squeeze of lemon.  It was excellent and the fries were fine too.

I finished with some excellent decaf and a glass of Kahlua--I had had iced tea with the meal so some alcohol was not an excess.

A lady who was some sort of hostess dropped by my table while I was eating to make sure everything was OK and when told I needed ketchup (for the fries), went and got me some (in a dainty little single-serve Heinz bottle).  My waiter also checked several times but didn''t hover.

I am giving it 4 stars.  The 5th star is withheld because of the crowded dining room and noise level . . . nothing to do with the food which I greatly enjoyed."

I chose pumpkin cake flavor which was delicious and smooth. I also got pralines and cream that was better than other praline ice creams. The Tennessee fudge was vanilla with fudge swirled it was good not too special. 

The next time I came I got nutter butter ice cream that was really good had cookie pieces in it! I got the hot fudge topping over it and that was a great combination.

I, and many others, am incredibly lucky and grateful that these services exist.  Going through all sorts of life challenges can be painful and frightening when you know you''re assumed to be a certain way.  Here, there are no assumptions.  They know who they''re working with, and they are sensitive without the need to pry for information.  If you''re in need of gynecology and you''re not a woman, for example, they know exactly how to handle your needs while prioritizing respect for your identity.

My biggest concern is the physical space in which the Mazzoni Center clinic exists.  I feel sort of exposed in the waiting room.  I hope that they someday have the funds to upgrade to a larger, more private space.

If you visit during youth drop-in hours rather than making an appointment, you will probably wait a very long time to see someone.  This is completely understandable, in my opinion.  They''ll advise you regarding what time you should show up if you call.

Occasionally, I''ve noticed lapses in communication; I have been kept waiting in the exam room before with no one around and no idea how much longer I would have to wait.  This is not a common issue, and I find that, overall, I receive more attentive service here than at any other clinic I''ve visited.

I ordered the sample platter, horrific, the chicken looked and tasted like frozen pressed meat, the ribs.... All cartilage, the sausage, bland.... The sauce.... Walmart basic sauce with cups of sugar thrown in.... Extremely overpriced for ummm.... A child''s plate (what it seemed like). I would never recommend this place to anyone."

Hard to justify $16 for a burger and fries BUT wowow this burger was so delicious. I''m not sure if I was just starving but ordered the Lama burger and the patty size is quality. They also have random ingredients thrown in that you probably haven''t seen before like gruyere stuffed in a pepper on your burger. Fries came out nice and crisp vs. soggy and the bun on that burger was great. You order inside by the Nook and then can sit around. They have tons of craft beer to choose from and I could see this place getting packed on the weekends."

Omelets were executed well, and the pastries were pretty impressive.

But the coffee was horrendously bad. And without good coffee, what''s the point of breakfast?

They have a great selection of beers on tap and bottles. The food is superb! If you''re looking for a private party space, they have a cozy basement space with a personal bar. Only thing is occasionally you''ll have some crashers who want to use the ATM and restroom (even though there is one on the second floor and 2 on the 3rd)

I was surprised to be seated next to another party on the same table with just a small partition separating us. This is how some of the tables are if you are a party of 4 or less. The restaurant is small and can get loud. We had very good service. The food was ok, we got the Kale Ceaser and the Fried chicken with mac n cheese. They were out of watermelon so the salad that was supposed to come with the chicken had to be changed to something else. I was impressed with the soft egg that came with Kale ceaser, it was nicely encased in a crispy crust and the yolk was nice and runny."

This is a 5 mile wide/long convention center. It has up to 2,000 guestrooms.  The conference I went to had 6,000 attendants. Of course I booked late and I didn''t want to spend $200+/night on these hotel rooms! Otherwise this place is ginormous. The service (shuttle), lunch/drinks were really well done.  This place is immaculate; I do not know how many workers they staff.  

The food of course is overpriced (I had lunch/dinner at Wasabi. My bento box was $25.  Overpriced right?)  I also had lunch at the pizza place Paisano (forgot the name).   

If you decide to stay at the hotels across the street from the convention center (it is only 1 mile away - across from the McGovick Pwky).  They have Cracker Barrel, Apple Bees, Chillis?, McDonalds there.  The hotel I stayed in (being on a student budget) was crappy but I can''t complain for $55/night.  It was Days Inn. It was walkable to shuttle pick up stop at Marriott Hotel (walk ~0.3 miles).  

They have Finleys pub, FUSE (night/club), STAX burger, Jack Daniels and more restaurants inside this convention center.  

I posted some photos."

We have done this on several occasions, and the kids love that they each get their own personal pizza, made the way they like.   They both ordered their pizza with 2 items and wanted BBQ sauce as the base instead of tomato sauce.  (this is the only way they enjoy pizza).   I was told that they could only get tomato sauce, not BBQ sauce.   I explained that we have gotten it this way several times before.   We were told that they don''t offer it this way any more.   I see that some of the pizzas offer BBQ sauce and pointed it out, but again was told that it couldn''t be made this way for them.   I asked if I could pay additional to have it made with BBQ sauce, but once again told it was not possible.   Sadly, we left the restaurant and chose a different nearby restaurant for lunch.

Everything was really good,i could have done without the tacos, but the lamb sliders and the steak and cake were AMAZING. The goat cheese paired with the lamb was to die for.

Their coffee is flavorful and their presentation is nice. I really liked the fact that their lattes and cappuccinos have beautiful latte art on top. The store has a beautiful modern design that reminds me of coffee shops in New York. 

This particular location is in Hyde Park Village. The benefit is that parking is free. The down side is that seating is limited. The store is also extremely cold, so it is uncomfortable to sit and socialize for very long. You may be better off getting your coffee to go and walking around Hyde Park Village instead."

They have a good kids menu, enough to keep the little ones content with options like burgers, Alfredo pasta, chicken, shrimp, quesadilla, etc.  

We started with the Crabby Dip which the whole family enjoyed but feel it was a little overpriced at $14.  For the main course I enjoyed a Salty Burger while she had the macadamia crusted grouper, both were excellent choices!  Service was spot on making this a five star experience for us!"

Unfortunately, all the hotels in Santa Barbara are pretty freaking pricey. A lot of the other hotels started at $400+ /night.  This ain''t Vegas where you can get something pretty cushy for $250. This seemed like a decent option on the lower end. Our rooms were about $250 a night. A lot of the other hotels in the area were already booked for the weekend or required more than one night to book. 

Pros: 
-decently priced
-clean and cozy rooms
-charming exterior and grounds
-relatively comfortable beds
-bath and body works shampoo, body wash etc
-free water bottles and fruit waiting for you in the room

Cons:
-dated decor 
-toilet issues: The hook inside kept coming undone. I guess we decided not to get maintenance because we temporarily fixed it, but it kept coming undone so it wouldn''t really flush. We were checking out that day, so we decided just to deal with it. 
- door was difficult to open without using a certain technique
-no hair dryer, so bring your own
-no complimentary breakfast
-a bit noisy in the morning, but I slept fine. I guess the window in the bathroom was open or something for some ventilation.

Overall, I still don''t think I would''ve chosen to stay anywhere else in Santa Barbara, so BW Pepper Tree Inn was still a good choice based on the location of the bachelorette and price range."

Gumbo - rich with the andouille sausage adding just a bit of heat. Crab bisque - flavored with old bay style seasoning but not overly salty and just a bit of shredded crab. The entree was a garganelli with roast pork ragu, mushrooms and creole tomatoes.  The sauce was light and blended the flavors well.

Darn shame too as I really did like this place, but I must admit that I still am not confident they have their act in order. My suggestion is they need to cook their meat longer and ensure it reaches optimum 165°F Temp, serve the food very hot temp to ensure bacteria are dead, and only source their greens and veggies from USA only sources. Avoid Mexico as they have big issues with water pollution cross-contamination."

NOM NOMS
Although you probably won''t get full on the sizes, the food is like little art works of flavor. My bowl of mussels and clams was HUGE and I sopped up the buttery, faintly spiced broth with the accompanying breadstick. Well done. The other appetizers like Tuna Tartare and Coconut Shrimp each had awesome flavor surprises - fresh, melty tuna and a wasabi and jam sauce respectively - both excellent and plated beautifully.

My cocktail The Tryst didn''t impress. Watery and a strange alcohol after taste. I''ll forget it tomorrow. 

SERVICE
Thanks Yelp for introducing me here. It''s easy to get overlooked at the bar, but once seated, our server was quick and helpful and was great at lowering my inhibitions by telling me what to expect in a vegetable beer they offered--spot on. 

SUMMARY
I''ll probably stick to the drinks only here because the food prices are above my range... or go during happy hours. Cool, hip place to bring the girlfriends or if you''re looking for impressive, gutsy art dishes with good taste.... and if you have cash to blow (but I won''t let that subtract a review star)"

Was nice and quiet as it was a Tuesday and the service was good because of that.  I''m sure it normally is though based on the size of the place.  

I had beef n lobster which both were cooked well and I was happy.  Also the mashed and asparagus that came with it were both very good.  

I wasn''t to stoked with the appy we had which was these crab and cheese balls as they were very bland with little crab taste and no real seasoning it seemed.  Maybe just not for me but I wouldn''t recommend those. 

Also had Creme Brule which was solid and is get it again for sure.  

Overall I''d say four due to a couple things like the appy and the shaky table, seriously so stupid to have that at a place that nice.  

But I''d gladly go again and would tell friends to try it."

Great atmosphere and feel to this place - Kind of an art house meets coffee house meets Animal House environment. Very unusual. In a good way. The service was relaxed, social and great. The beverages were delicious and the menu was quite interesting. 
I so wanted the food to be much better than it was. Tried the Bird and Pig, a specialty grilled cheese and a couple apps. Everything was good but not great. In truth, if I was judging on food alone, there would be three stars instead of four. But the atmosphere and the staff clearly deserved the extra star, and I''ll head back to try some other items on the menu next visit."

It''s tiny, but we were there on a Tuesday evening, and only had to wait a few minutes. We ended up sitting at the bar; it would have been a longer wait for a table outside, since there are so few. Because of its size, it''s a little noisy, but not bad. The service was very good. My husband had the crab sandwich, and wasn''t impressed. It''s served on very uninspiring white bread. I had the fried shrimp, and enjoyed it very much; it was not greasy or heavy, and the shrimp was moist and tasty. There is literally nothing but shellfish on the menu. So, the non-seafood enthusiast (me) was happily surprised to enjoy the shrimp so much (plus good onion rings), but the seafood enthusiast (my husband) didn''t love the crab sandwich. If we tried this place again, he would order something else. The location is awesome, so if you like shellfish, definitely give this place a try."

Though I came close to finishing all 4lbs of burgers, fries, and fixings, I fell short on time. Our server was kind enough to issue me a shirt for attempting and coming the closest to finishing. Whatever that meant. The food was good, staff was great, and the challenge left me with a stomach ache for 3-days. 

I did not get a chance to sample their beer selections but from what my friends said, it''s good. I would not recommend the burger challenge if you''re going to drink beer. Otherwise for $24, it''s by far the best deal on the menu; especially if you split with friends! (splitting the meal violates the rules of the competition)

If I''m ever in the Reno area again, I will be back to conquer that elusive challenge!"

I needed my factory navigation unit in my Denali replaced, and needed to know costs and in writing.  Now this is a normal standard procedure for an auto repair shop.  Let''s just assume its bad (it is), so tell me how much it is to remove bad part, and put the new one in.

Jay Fatimo or something like that, said he was very busy, as were the other service writers, so he handed me his card, and said to just email him with what I needed.  Sounded like a good plan, I wasn''t in a big rush.  So I did just that, sent a picture of my vin, and the appropriate RPO codes to know what part I needed, and emailed it all to him.  I never got a response.  I tried again about a week or so later, still nothing.  Made sure it is his email at the dealership, etc.  

I guess I have a hard time with taking my car in or trusting a place to do such repairs (3000 dollar job according to Winkel GMC) if they can''t even respond to an email.  He knew I would email that day, and I did.  

I guess the GMC dealer right next door gets my money instead."

We all ordered cocktails (I got the Mint Julep, which was not great, but then a gin drink that was fantastic), and they were all pretty and tasty. We also ordered Mac and cheese, fries, Brussels sprouts, and a pretzel. I didn''t try the sprouts (I really don''t like them), but everything else was so good! And the prices during happy hour were a great deal.

Speaking of the staff, they are amazing. Checking in is fantastic, Jasmine and Kayla are the ones I dealt with and they are both wonderful. The hotel concierge Roshid is a very friendly and knowledgeable concierge, they are very lucky to have him on staff. The housekeepers are great, the rooms are immaculate. What I love most about this hotel are the fantastic bathrooms, I''m not sure about the regular rooms, but if you get a king spa room, the bathrooms are absolutely amazing. You have a freestanding tub, and a large shower and you can jump in between the two should you be so inclined ha ha. The decor is so attractive, incredible wallpaper, beautiful rugs, everything seems brand new and they keep it in perfect condition. This hotel is a must for anyone visiting Philadelphia. They make you feel right at home at the moment you step in the door. The pictures that you can get from inside the rooms are enough to make up your whole trip to Philly LOL. But if you want to get out and explore Philly you''re only steps away from the Liberty Bell and a historical museum. Right in Center City or the old downtown area, you''ll find lots of historical information about Philadelphia.  Definitely stop in and stay at the Monaco, you won''t regret it!"

I also love the Athenian Chicken (half a rotisserie chicken).

I ordered a taste of another similar dark beer to see if the problem was endemic but it wasn''t. I would have appreciated it more if the bar tender looked into the off flavor when I sent my beer back. This tells me the bar tender doesn''t know beer. I assume that particular draft line needs to be cleaned but maybe the problem was with the keg. 

Another thing that killed me was their use of glassware. They serve beers in the classic American Shaker pint glass and serve water in the far superior English Nonic Pint glass. I also saw the bar tender pour a white ale with normal ABV in a stemmed tulip glass.

The shaker pint glasses are kept refrigerated and are too cold in my opinion. I would much rather see them kept at room temp and rinsed in cold water (which they do here). 

All in all, the beer knowledge is not up to par for a place that advertises as a burger joint with a large craft beer selection (30 taps)."

Wax 1- I had Despina, I think her name was. I waited a good 15 minutes after my appointment time for her to come and get me from the front. Ironic they have a 9 minute policy that if you don''t show they''ll cancel/charge you or whatever. Anyway, as for the experience with Despina, she did not speak to me. Like at all. Made me feel super awkward the whole time, and missed a fair few chunks of hair. She didn''t ask me anything about myself, didn''t tell me where to sit or how she wanted me positioned etc. Luckily I got this one half price as it was my first time at EWC.

Wax 2- I booked 3-4 weeks later with Amy Jo (based on previous Yelp reviews). She was a lot friendlier (literally the only reason why I''m giving this 1 star) BUT way too sloppy. I think it''s safe to say this is the worst wax I''ve ever had. She left half of my hair on right before Valentine''s Day! I understand they can''t get all the hairs all the time but a lottttt of hair right on top was left clearly visible to my waxer. My apt was at 3.45, I walked out of the building at 3.53. Really. This includes the time spent undressing, redressing, and paying. 8 minutes is not long enough for all of this. It went so quick that when she said she was done I was actually shocked.  
I''m about to go to CVS and get some at home wax strips to finish the job... For $47+ I expect way way more. 

The staff- Another reason why I won''t be returning. The ladies at the front desk are generally rude and disinterested in showing any glimpse of good customer service. ALSO, I don''t like being asked if I''m going to tip - can''t you give me the card machine so I can do it myself rather than make me announce if I would like to tip and how much?

Not only were they able to fit me in with the exact specific type I needed, but they also were able to fit my father in at the exact same time. Jen was understanding and nice, she asked me questions and checked up on me constantly. She even showed me some at home techniques I could use. She took her time, obviously did not rush. Carrie, I believe, was the name of the woman who did a foot massage on my father. He was very pleased and recommended I try it sometime.

GBTPC53ZrG1ZBY3DT8Mbcw,Luke,333 Saint Charles Ave,New Orleans,LA,70130,4554,3EUIprHie45xiT75nJERbw,4,"If you are looking to be impressed by French-German dishes in New Orleans, please go to Luke Restaurant, I know I was. 

The restaurant is located in the Central Business District, next to the Hilton and in the former Masonic Temple Building, so there is that historic vibe to the restaurant. The front room is a lot more grand than the back room (where we were seated), but that is offset by views of the open kitchen. 

Apparently they only want to seat people with reservations, so since we did not have one, we were refused seating until 9:15pm (it was 6:45pm) but with a little back and forth, we ended up waiting only 15 minutes before we were seated. However, as we walked through the restaurant to the back room, way too many tables were empty that it made no sense that they acted that way. A lot of tables still remained empty throughout the meal.

I decided to start out my meal with a cocktail. I originally wanted the Mint Julep but they were out so I had the Riverbend (vodka, lemon juice, basil syrup, blueberries & ginger ale) at the recommendation of the server. It was a relatively sweet cocktail, with the ginger ale being the most powering flavor, but you could still taste the alcohol.

My friend choose a regular starter and ordered a cup of the Crawfish Bisque. She ate all of it so I am assuming she liked it, but she did complain of a sour aftertaste.

My boyfriend skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. He always seems to find the most basic item on the menu and order it. He had the Luke Burger (bacon, caramelized onions, tomatoes, Swiss cheese) and was raving about it. One thing I can tell you, it was a very good size. 

My friend had the Jumbo Louisiana Shrimp En Cocotte with lump crab meat, roasted jalapeño cheese grits, andouille & green onion sausages. She loved it.

I have an obsession with mussels so I had the classic Moules et Frites. Although only having two simply ingredients (garlic & thyme) in the broth, the flavors stood out and the taste was a lot bolder than others I have had with a lot more ingredients. The house-made fries were scrumptious. These are the best kind.

Even with all that food, we still made room for dessert. We first had the Bread Pudding which was delicious but quite sweet. I am also not a fan of over sauced foods.

One wasn''t enough so we also ordered the Bourbon Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee. It was superb and not too sweet which is a plus for me. The little cookies on top added nothing to the dessert and if anything could have been left off.

All that good food, I still have to give props to our server. He was amazing and engaging. The front desk soured the mood a little bit a first but he more than made up for it. I couldn''t have asked for anyone better."

She got all the brassy color out of my hair and made my blonde look natural and vibrant. 

Blonde hair isn''t easy and I was expecting to have to go back a couple of times to someone new until they got it just right. I was wrong.

Stacey nailed the color and was really nice to chat with too! Also a must when hanging in a chair for hours. 

Highly recommend... Although I may regret it if she gets too booked up :)"

A friend and I stopped here during an evening of bar hopping in the CBD. We were seated promptly and given our menus, which are half-French, half-English. Not a big deal for anyone who can read French and/or has been living in Louisiana for a reasonable amount of time, but definitely something tourists should be wary of. I didn''t have any alcohol because I was the designated driver, but I can say that their drink menu is extensive, and the bar was packed from the moment we arrived until the moment we left. 

This restaurant''s biggest strength is it''s food. I tasted their crab bisque, and had Poulet Grand-Mère as my entrée. Both were excellent. The latter arrived in a wide cast-iron bowl, which I''m sure has a more proper name, but was an interesting touch nonetheless.

The service was why I gave this restaurant 4/5 instead of 5/5. Most of the wait staff seemed to be interns from culinary school. The handful we dealt with were very friendly, but would do well to be a little more attentive. For example, the server who brought us our desserts ran off before we could ask for spoons to eat the dessert with. 

In summary, a good dining experience, but I think I would rather continue exploring new restaurants in the area before returning."

I used to go to Don Pablo''s but I fell in love with On the Border''s chips and salsa (their chips are nice and salty, and their salsa is a little spicier).

When I go, 90% of the time I just sit at the bar and drink beer and snack on their chips and salsa. The beer specials are pretty good but could be a little better- weekdays has a happy hour as well as a late night happy hour too.

When I do dine, I often just enjoy a variety of vegetarian sides. Lately, I''ve grown to enjoy their cheese enchiladas, which I find delicious. Service when dining is usually great.

As for the bartenders, it''s really hit-or-miss. Joann is probably my favorite- she''s friendly, attentive, funny, and I''ve really gotten to know her, and I''d give them 5 stars if my experience was with her alone. There is a bartender named Nikki though, and if she''s there, I always get the worst service. She barely checks on me/us to see how we''re doing, she seems unfriendly, if she actually comes to refill your chips then she will not refill your salsa, she has taken my beer and refilled it without asking (when I was done and trying to leave), and I''ve had to wait forever to ask her for my check. At least twice, I''ve had to ask other bartenders to bring my check so that I could finally close out and leave. I''d give them 1 star if my experience was based on her alone.

Overall, good appetizers, cold beer, moderate prices, and usually good service."

This time I tried Wei Hong. I told my partner it can''t be any worse than the other mediocre places we have been going. I was wrong.
The take out service was fast for a Sat night. We were there within 20 minutes of ordering and it was ready. But the dining room was empty. For a Sat night that should have been a big clue. The rest of the places in the neighborhood were busy.
The steamed dumplings could have been great. The tasted homemade and the filling was good. However, they were so doughy with a really thick wrapper too thick that it detracted from the good filling. Everything else went downhill from there. 
The beef and broccoli was inedible. The beef had an awful weird texture. Like it was boiled and was gelatinous.  The sauce on it had off flavors. We literally scraped it off our plates and threw the whole thing out.  The meat in both the general Tao''s chicken and the orange beef also had weird textures. It was mushy and the coating was thick on those as well. The flavors in the sauces would have been fine, but they were gloopy.  The fried rice was fair but nothing memorable.

Ahh, the breadsticks. This is where the attitude part kicks in. These things are advertised as as much as you want for free. However, my buddy heads up to the front counter to request enough for our table of three only to be given a hard time from the manager that we''re eating more breadsticks than what we ordered. Give me a break. Don''t advertise what you don''t want to deliver.

Even ordering was a chore. It seemed as if they had a new hire manning the register during the lunch hour rush. She was placing orders as to-go for people looking to dine-in and had to have the manager place orders for her. Not a good idea for a Friday lunch rush.

If this Fazoli''s location can improve upon these things minor inconveniences, it''d be a great place to grab a quick bite."

saw the sign as i was about to turn into riverside plaza to make my groceries and decided it was time.  got the basic $12 tchoup and even though there were about 5 cars in the vacuum line ahead of me, my car was ready before i was done checking out the waiting area.  iguanas, parrots, ms. pac man ($1 a game?  the price of nostalgia, i guess).  not to mention the windows that look out into the auto wash system - which is really entertainment enough for me.  i''m not picky.

but then my number was up and i went out and inspected the results.  still some bird poop remnants on the hood and a few bugs didn''t give up the ghost on the grill...maybe i am picky after all.  

don''t get me wrong - it was better than nothing (which was what my car got in terms of washings since mid-january), but i''m missing my favorite car wash right about now.  their regular automatic wash with vacuum and window cleaning (i.e. the tchoup treatment) is $14, true, but those dudes are much more thorough with the elbow grease post-assembly line washing.

but that place is in los angeles, alas.  which is perhaps the best gauge of how pricey this place is: 85% as expensive as l.a., but 66.67% the quality.  worth it?  you do the math.  i''ma try a completely touchless system next time.  i reckon i''ll get about the same results, but with no parrots or ms. pac-man."

Usually there is no wait or 5 minute wait at this time. One big complaint is that they don''t have an organized system for seating guests. The servers don''t always greet incoming patrons (which should be required Waffle House-style) and they sometimes tell you to seat yourself (which can lead to one or two people taking up tables for 4) or they''ll seat you (whenever they get around to talking to you). 

I''ve ordered a several different dishes at this point and they have varies from ok to awesome. The chicken wings and onion rings are just ok. The wings are either lightly dredged in flour or not at and then fried whole. They aren''t really seasoned so the wings are pretty bland. The onion rings made of formed, chopped onions that are breaded. The chicken fingers were a bit over battered and dry. The smashwich (or whatever it''s called) was pretty good: your choice of breakfast meat with hash browns and eggs in a hoagie roll, but unspectacular. The club sandwich is classic diner fare that is very well executed. The egg and omelette platters are a very good deal and dang tasty. The best thing on the menu is definitely the waffle. It''s gently sweet, very crispy and covered in butter. So good!

Good food can last for a day or two.When i went in there to eat the hostess was nice. first, we ordered a glass a wine. he poured the wine, missed the glass and some spilled on the table and he just ignored it. hello. idiot. waitressing 101. go back. well needless to say. not worth your money at all. ive been there during happy hour with girlfriends and its fine. not a ''high end'' restaurant by any means even though they try to make it that way."

There was a lot of things to do for my daughter and she loved it! I would''ve given this place 5 stars but I''m only giving it 2 stars because this place is filthy. For the price that we paid for each admission including my 15 month old daughter, management should do a way better job maintaining the cleanliness of this place!!! I did not see any staff wipe down anything the whole entire, there were electrical cords hanging around where kids can touch, and there were dust everywhere!!!! I was pretty disappointed!!! I really hope management will look into this and improve it. I never write any reviews but I feel this was definitely something I need to share."

I never give out review on Yelp, but I had to comment on this restaurant! I am a sushi lover, the fish was poorly cut and the sushi rice is tasteless.

I also had an order of plantains that were the best I''ve ever had. The owner came out to chat and made sure we''d gotten enough food and liked everything. 

The prices are incredible, and evidently there are some things not on the menu, such as oxtails, that are available. 

Also- it''s a BYOB!

1. The price: Expect to pay a lot of money from the second you arrive. They charge $35 per person for a round trip shuttle ride to the airport. Our room was roughly $275 a night. It''s an incredibly large hotel that offers a nail salon, a Godiva Chocolate store, about 9 restaurants and a few bars. But you''ll pay dearly for any of those things - like $2.50 for a small bottle of soda. The hotel is designed to keep you in there and they charge you $15 for a round trip shuttle ride to the downtown Nashville area. 

2. The service: We called the front desk and were on hold for 20 minutes. We went to the front desk and waited in line for an hour. We waited around to ask the concierge questions. And each time we got, I don''t know as the usual response. The cleaning staff was extraordinarily loud and they actually shouted as they went down the hall at 6:30 a.m.

3. The name: They call this place a resort but that is, by far, a misnomer. This place is a convention hotel, period. It''s horrifically loud at all hours of the day because they host about 3 conventions at one time. Our windows faced one of the courtyards and there is music pumping there 24 hours a day. The walls are thin and you can hear *everything* happening in the neighboring rooms. (eww!) If you want to relax at a resort, don''t stay here because with all those convention people, loud cleaning staff, 24 hour music and thin walls you will only end up with more stress.

4. The size: It''s no joke that you will get lost in this hotel. It''s inexplicably large. And when it hits noon, you should already be in one of the few restaurants because they fill up FAST. With several conventions happening at one time, getting a quick bite is not possible here. And there''s not really any place close by, either. You can walk over to the mall for some fast food but plan enough time for your walk - getting out of the hotel takes at least 5 minutes.

I''m sure glad I was there for a convention and didn''t pay out of my own pocket for this ridiculous hotel."
MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,Han Dynasty,3711 Market St,Philadelphia,PA,19104,783,MB53hHzv_IMAcLcQsLbReg,3,"I waited a long time to finally try this place and I have to say I was let down a bit. I tried the mandatory Dan Dan noodles. They were very flavorful and not too spicy. Nothing mind blowing here just a really good lo mein or spicy pasta dish with virtually no protein more or less. Also had the scallion pancakes. I was just in Chinatown recently at a place I also reviewed (first person from Yelp to do so) and they were way better there. ( I highly recommend you try that place) These were more like quesadillas laying flat where as the other ones jumped off the plate and were so much more crispy and substantial. The last appetizer I had was the Wontons in Chilli oil. These were just not good to me at all and one bite was all I needed. Basically it is steamed Wontons in a bowl with the soup being the chilli oil. Just heavy heavy choking heat with very little substance or taste. Take those same homemade wontons and pan fry them with some chilli peppers and a nice light sauce and you have could a real winner but I digress. Finally we tried the Talapia Medallions . These were fried to perfection but there were some greens mixed in that I could not chew through and had to discard via the old napkin trick which to me is a bit of a deal/star breaker.

The service was very good and the atmosphere very nice but I wouldn''t go out of my way to eat here again. All I could think about was how much more I prefer Cantonese style where its all about flavors and you can add heat as you like it. I''m sure I could find better authentic Szechuan cuisine that better suits my taste just not here. It feels very commercialized and Americanized. I prefer the hole in the wall places where I am the only caucasian in the place a heck of a lot more."

The old locations was a bit more home style feeling and cozy and the new spot has a more modern vibe to it. I applaud the change in style with the change in times. Too many places get stuck doing the same thing over and over again. I am glad to see that the food is still delicious. The Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm, house salad and Alfredo are some of my favorites and they have great pizza. The alfredo sauce is made to order and taste amazing with their breadsticks. Some appetizer items leave something to be desired like the frozen cheesesticks or calimari. I would love to see these replaced with better quality items. Overall, I still love this place and would choose it over Olive Garden any day. I do miss the homey old school vibe from the old location but I also miss the good old days when people talked to each other, fragglerock ruled and hip hop was Wu Tang Clan. Oh well...."

Waited over an hour to be seated today and about an hour to get food. I just do not have 2 hours available to get breakfast. They do not have the proper staffing to quickly get the food out and clear tables in a timely fashion. There were many upset people there due to the time to wait. While we were eating there were 2 empty tables for at least 15 minutes that they did not seat anyone at yet when we left there was a longer line than when I arrived which we waited an hour to be seated. The workers were trying but were simply overwhelmed. Management needs to do a better job handling the staffing schedules. I will not be coming back due to this experience.

They are nice people and corrected my order but instead of simply picking up my food I had to wait 20 minutes To get my original order. When all was said and done, the food was good.

I was nearby and decided to give them a second chance. This time I ordered a pizza steak and I was really impressed! I need to have a couple more before I can declare them my new favorite pizza steak. Plenty of mozzarella cheese and the roll is stuffed with meat and just enough sauce.

Thank God Luke was connected to our hotel!!!  We ended up eating here 3 times over 5 days.  It''s usually full of business suits, but that doesn''t bother me when the food is so good.

All the traditional dishes were good, but the huge surprise was the burger.  I was against ordering a burger while I was in New Orleans, because I wanted to try as many local eats as possible... and you can find burgers anywhere.  I overheard this lady raving about how delicious her burger was, so I had to order it the next time we ate there.  She was absolutely right!  It was one of the best burgers I''ve ever had!  It was huge, juicy, and packed with flavor.  I also highly recommend getting their bread pudding a la mode.  It was mouth-watering good and straight out the oven!"

This isn''t Greek; it isn''t even Mediterranean. It''s pseudo-Americanized versions of Mediterranean classic cuisine. The corporate chefs got so many things wrong:  Skordalia is a classic Greek dip made out of potatoes and garlic (not bread).  Avgolemono is chicken soup with egg, lemon and rice -- not this thin, awful broth they are currently serving. If one wants true Greek cooking, one should go to Greektown in either Detroit or Toronto. 
Just say no."

Juicy, glistening melting with cheese - simplistic yet tastes completely different from other burger joints due the quality of the ingredients. Bacon looks good in pictures, but it was a too thick of slice of puuuure white fat, if it would have melted in my mouth it would have worked but it didn''t therefore just felt sinful, in a bad way. 

Unfortunately, this communal table trend has got to go. 
I hate it, it''s a crap shoot on who your going to get to sit next to and basically listen to a complete strangers stupid conversations. Terrible idea."

There were 20+ in our party each night and the service was pretty good. Only a few forgotten drinks, which was to be expected with such a large group. 
Portions are huge and food was good. I had the Cuban sandwich one night and it was massive but delicious. The shandy is good. The margaritas are not and I don''t recommend their patron one. I forget the name but it wasn''t that good. Their shrimp tacos have a kick but they''re good too."

We didn''t want to wait in line and wanted instant gratification. Although we may have felt tired, my bf and I were appropriately dressed to go to Mr. B''s. As soon as we walked in, I felt transported into a different world. Jazz music was playing and I felt at home. 

First of all, I could not have been more grateful for the fresh loaf of bread we were given. We devoured it in a matter of minutes. Then came the gumbo ya-ya. It was spicy and savory and everything I expected from a gumbo. Finally came the bbq shrimp. We had been warned that these shrimp did come with their heads and tails on. Bibs were placed around our necks and we were off. The shrimp were some of the most rich and delicious ones I have ever tasted. The sauce they were served with was divine. Although it was messy, there is no other dish on the menu I would have traded for this.

Overall, service was friendly and quick at Mr. B''s. The food was delicious, although a little pricey. Definitely try the brunch if you are able to."

The Apps were OK. We ended up getting the Carmine''s trio (crab cakes, scallops and toasted ravioli). Crab cakes were above average. The scallops were a little saccharine for my tastes but the ravioli was good; and let''s face it...one doesn''t come to St. Louis for the scallops. Thankfully the filet mignon was exceptional. It was the perfect size, not too salty and rare just like I had requested. 

This was partnered with an above average wine list to make a great night out."

Firstly, I came here specifically for the chicken slider because from the picture it showed that you can get it on a biscuit and when I told the lady taking my order, she said they don''t do that -__-. Then I wanted that buttermilk bites and they weren''t available, however, my brother ordered the brown buttered cream sundae and got the buttermilk bites in that!! Oh yes, and the glazed donuts are so thick and dry. I liked the sliders I had though: fried chicken, beef belly and catfish(okay). And the sundae is pretty tasty.

I am not the type to complain, but I have been here twice and both times I have had terrible service at the bar. The first bartender served me but acted as if I was bothering him.  This second time, with a completely different bartender mind you, it was worse. I am not dressed like a street person or anything, and I am not pan-handling. But you would think that I was the way he acted. First, I sit at the bar and I am waiting for service. So, the bartender walks by me, pours a glass a water, turns in front of me, puts the water down, gives me some stupid half-grin then walks off. Not one audible word of greeting or a grunt passed between his lips. Then, he gets a menu, drops that down and walks off again! Not a sound. Is it me, but when a customer enters an eating establishment, shouldn''t they be greeted in some manner?  Not looked at like why are you here. I have better things to do?  I am not looking for a royal salute or anything. Just Hey man, what can I get ya?  or something to that affect.   Anyway, I start to look at the drink and food menus. Then, a group of anywhere from 10-15 people come in behind me and say, to what looked like a manager, We don''t want to eat, is it ok if we just have a few drinks at the bar?. The manager says Sure. The guy then says, Can we get few beers down here? (paraphrasing). The bartender says Sure! and proceed to service this group, one-by-one, as they order drinks. Ok, fine technically, I was looking at the menu when this started. But still, he walked back and forth, right in front of me, for about 10-12 minutes. Not once did he say, Hey, just shout and I will get you something, or Hey man, just give me a few minutes and I will be right with you. Nothing!  It was obvious it was a big group, but I mean, he gave no acknowledgement to the fact that I was sitting there waiting! 

Long story short - after this 10-12 minutes of waiting, I just walked out and went somewhere else. Now this place has about 4\5 stars with around 500 reviews. So, I guess people like it. But their bartenders are as unfriendly as I have ever encountered.  Maybe if you get a table it''s different."

The wax specialist Miriam was prompt and knew what she was doing. She spent much of our hour together telling me why my regular shaving is bad and waxing is good, and seriously marketing the EWC products to me. 
Brows and lower legs were done well. Underarms were left with a decent number of stray hairs which she told me I could tweeze out later. Little bits of wax were left on my skin here and there. Overall I felt like I did not walk out of there ready to hit the beach."

I upgraded myself to the executive locker rooms because that gives me zero excuses for why I can''t go to the gym before work or after if I am going out later that night. I always have my makeup, hair stuff, etc in my locker. Just getting back to the gym after a long absence due to health issues so I''m taking it slow. I''ve seen one or two machines that are not quite working right but the facility as a whole is pretty sharp & welcoming. You have tons of options of what to do classes wise, equipment wise...
My only 2 down sides are that I wish they were open a little later on weekends, but that''s just me moving slowly on my time off. I wish there was a bit more ritation with the class schedule. There are classes I''d like to take but they always run mid day, never really early, after work or weekends. So no option to try them.

I have to say, this place is great and one of the biggest reasons why is their bar staff. There is a bartender named Ally. She is always kind and attentive.

Cool vibe, great indoor and outdoor seating. Great addition to the Funk Zone.

Little far from town but a good middle point between music row and the airport. Hotel staff was top notch and the place was clean while still having that old charm.

Arrived at opening and found the off season price within reason. Bathrooms and water park were immaculate. The lifeguards were attentive and friendly. 
A star was lost because I found the water and air temp to be a tad too cold. The park was smaller then other indoor water parks I''ve been to. Only two big slides, one group slide, a couple of younger kids areas, lazy river and a simulated surf area. They would periodically close the big slides in order to open the surf area, for lack of staffing. A minor annoyance since that is why we were there. 
I can see how people  would be upset paying more and sharing the park with hundreds of others. But I think if your timing is right, you could have an enjoyable afternoon.
We did save money by using our AAA card. Could have saved more as it was my sons birthday month, but I didn''t have proof on me."

Since Friendly''s closed a few years ago, Warminster has sorely needed a new ice cream place (DQ was our last one standing for quite some time). 

Much to my dismay, the Big Scoop had already closed for the season. I marked it in my calendar go return in March, when it reopened. Upon my next trip home in the spring, I was disappointed to see that I was just a few days early for their reopening, and would have to wait until my return in April.

After much anticipation, I made it to Big Scoop last weekend with my sister (who has been before). I was shocked to see what a range of products they serve - hot dogs, funnel cake, onion rings, pizza, you name it! I was tempted at the prospect of waffles and ice cream, but I wasn''t that hungry so I settled for a scoop of chocolate chip cookie with hot fudge and whipped cream. The generous scoop of ice cream was tasty and packed with globs of cookie dough! I also tasted the birthday cake, which I enjoyed very much. 

The service was quick, and the shop crowded quickly. The interior was nicely remodeled and looks clean and family friendly. The man who helped me was extremely courteous and seemed to be doing most of the work. 

Especially given the lack of competition around here, the Big Scoop gets an easy four stars!"

I went to Las Cazuelas for the first time for my birthday.  We had a wonderful time.  I was looking for a fun and festive place to go with friends.  This was the perfect choice. We brought our own bottle of tequila, and they made tasty margaritas for the table.  Those were a big hit with my friends, and a cool twist for a Mexican BYOB.  The restaurant is cute.  Plus, the food here is delicious. 

I''m surprised this place doesn''t have higher reviews on Yelp, because it far exceeded my expectations... 

The guacamole appetizer was fresh and yummy.  I ordered the shrimp entree with rice and vegetables, and asked for it spicy.  My entrée had an attractive presentation on the plate (i.e. looked classy), and was delicious, well seasoned, and very fresh. On my suggestion, my partner ordered one of their mole sauce dishes (i.e. a sauce usually made from unsweetened chocolate and pureed pumpkin seeds), and it was tasty too. 

I should also note that the waitress was very attentive.  When I placed my order, I explained to her that I have mild lactose intolerance and can''t eat much butter or cream (but am okay with cheese), so she had the chef cook the veggies in olive oil, rather than butter.  Thanks for being so cool about accommodating that request!  

The prices are extremely reasonable for fancy and unusual Mexican food, and I love the fact they''re a BYOB.  The chef serves creative and inspired cuisine, which has a traditional flair and style to it.  In other words: Don''t come here for regular tacos or burritos.  Come here for a fun foodie experience at a reasonable price, and bring tequila for the perk of BYOB Margaritas!"

Great blend of flavors in everything on the menu. I went for a time where I had to have the pad-thai at least once a week. Never really that busy (but they should be). Staff is super friendly and attentive, Price is low if you are looking at the over all picture and compare it to the worth. THIS PLACE IS SUPER CLEAN!!!! Which in my opinion is a good way to judge a quality restaurant.... and this place is spotless. Not kidding at all on this,,, you could literally eat off the floors in the bathroom. Spotless.

If you live any where in the Tampa/Brandon area, do yourself a favor and check this place out... I want them to do well because I want to be able to eat there next time I am in town!!!!!!!!!!"

There isnt much different to say that everyone hasnt already said, so I will just reiterate some of the reasons why Taste of Havana will become a regular spot for us. 

I had the Pan con Bistec, and my wife had the Cuban. We loved the bread (and everything between it). Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal, but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night, so alas, I dont have another meal. Guess I''ll just have to go back! 

And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love. 

Try it out. Order a sandwich, have a seat, chat them up, and enjoy! I''m already looking forward to our next visit, and thinking about who else I want to bring with us.

Thank you for a wonderful evening!"

The car was considered Honda Certified.  It was a 2013. That basically meant they had thoroughly inspected the car.  When I test drove the car I did not notice the small crack in the window and scratches on the passenger side.  Their inspection said no cracks, chips etc.  That was my first clue I had made a mistake.  After I arrived home I looked at the financing.  I was charged a fee to get a better interest rate. The finance person also convinced me to get a protection package I had already told the sales person I did not want.  He had already put the package into the price on the paperwork.  The car had a Sonic price of 16900.  I put 6 thousand down and still owed over 16,000 on the car at 5 % interest for 72 months.  I could have bought a new car for that price.  Beware once you go to the finance department, they will try to get you!  Go to CARMAX, you have 5 days to return the car!!!!"

We rented a Pontoon boat to go spend the night on Anclote Sandbar. Our group was 3 adults and 2 kids. The staff was very friendly and informative of the rules to follow for safety.  We paid to have a porta-potty available on the boat since we were staying the night. If you''re just going for the day I doubt you''ll need it. 

Their website is REALLY informative. And you can read about other people''s experiences too. What I found useful were the stories about people who didn''t follow directions and had stuff happen. Understand their mistakes and you won''t fall into that problem. You WILL pay for emergency services. You WILL pay for broken equipment. You would charge someone accordingly if it was your business.

We had a great time camping on the Sandbar and would do it again without question. They offer more than just pontoon boats so check out their website and start making some memories!  See my pictures, because truly, words don''t do this beautiful little excursion we had justice!"

However, I had such a great experience at this location, I decided to write a review. I''ve been to many Apple locations from NY to Fl over the years and I can''t say the same of my experience.  As busy as they were, I was able to get an appt with the genius bar right away. I had two broken 4S iphones that needed to be looked at but I didn''t clarify that I had two devices when I made the appt, Nonetheless, after the  Genius bar tech, Tim, took one of the phones, Guy Schiavi who was on the floor, made sure that the second phone was looked at as well. It was not a simple process as both phones required a thorough diagnosis but I was truly impressed by how patient and accommodating Guy was with us.  He worked on my tween''s iphone and he walked her (us) through the process step by step and educated us on new tools on the iphone.  He also provided recommendations on phone accessories for me which I found very useful.  Unfortunately, the first phone (mine) was not fixable but my daughter''s phone was fine.  More than anything, it was all about the pleasant experience and the special attention we received from Guy.  I will definitely return to this location for any future Apple needs!"

As I''m writing this review, I can still picture the shrimp and even better, I can still taste it.    There are a few dishes I dream about and this is one of them.      We also tried the fried calamari; it was good.    I''m from the north where we like marinara sauce with calamari.   In the south it seems to be served with sweeter soy or  sweet chili based sauces which I''m still getting used to.    Our entrees were very good: po-boy and fish of the day.

The burgers are 6-7 bucks and definitely solid for the price though. I had the Route 66, 1/3 pound, nice soft potato roll, meat good and lean, pretty damn tasty and satisfying. Wish I could say the same about the fries/rings (I tried the mix) but they''re the standard freezer bag affair, and the fries are actually sub-par (dry and not much flavor, worse than most fast food fries). The onion rings were better, but of course they cost almost twice as much.

I''ll be back to try more burgers but would suggest just sticking to the burger or cheesesteak with no sides (maybe grab a shake for dessert instead ... the basic hot dog at $3 also costs about the same as an order of fries)."

I had Chicken Koobideh. I had little chicken in it''s taste and a lot of eggish taste.
Koobideh is more like Keema chicken from my experience, with nice mix of onions, chilly, and seasoning. 
So, on part of taste I rate it.

Apart that, uber interior, good service upper class experience. 
Food portion is generous and good enough for 2 for one order.

Over all ok ok. I would liked if they had served hummus and pita bread in their welcome. Also server salad as their sides. Middle eastern food is said to have perfect-balance of carbs, protein and fiber but it was found missing to call it a Middle Eastern fine dinner."

It comes with cane syrup and gravy on the side.  Ummm!  On a weekday, it is good for lunch or dinner with friends or the hubby.  I recommend the Luke burger (even though I believe it is sacrilegious to order a burger at an establishment such as this, however this is THE exception!) The flamenkutche is really good, too.  It is like a German pizza.  I also enjoy the cochondelait poboy, shrimp & grits, and croque madame , which are excellent.

Breakfast was average, same with lunch, which was a choice because the first two places we picked were closed for lunch hours. For the lunch visit, we split a patty melt and a corned beef sandwich. The menu made it sound like the corned beef was a hot open faced sandwich, but it was nothing more than cold lunchmeat and dressing. Everything was bland and under seasoned. Wait staff hung out by the counter a lot to talk, but seemed friendly when they approached our table. Food wasn''t ''bad'', but the only reason I''d really go back is because of the location and if I was in a hurry, no other reason to really go back, and I live in the immediate area."

2oav5QoWgnvTI2gO5xFMjw,Kimpton Hotel Monaco Philadelphia,433 Chestnut St,Philadelphia,PA,19106,499,Ti1_Kfd5RvRoonRo98BGcg,4,"I stayed at the Hotel Monaco on a recent visit to Philadelphia and I was impressed with almost everything. Everywhere I went in the hotel itself, staff were happy, friendly, and welcoming. This wasn''t the case only with me and it did not come across as fake or forced. I am a people watcher, so I observed the staff interacting with several guests and they were consistently good service providers. 

The Red Owl Tavern has great food, and generally great service, but while I was there for brunch, there was one server behind the ready-to-eat bar in the Tavern that was in a bad mood, unfriendly, aloof, or some combination of all three. She did not acknowledge people when they ordered-she would just turn around and start getting what they asked for. She also got into it with another server who apparently experienced the same rude attitude I and my fellow patrons did. I cannot emphasize enough that almost every other person there had a great attitude and was more than friendly. One bad apple...ironic since she has red hair. I realize that the Tavern is likely under different management, but it does affect a hotel guest''s experience, and in my case, it did so negatively. 

The only reason I can''t give the hotel 5 stars, however, has nothing to do with the Tavern. It is because our room was not touched once we checked in. Not one time. It was immaculate upon arrival, but that was the last time I saw it that way. I shouldn''t have to call the front desk for either a daily once-over or turn-down service. To be fair, I in fact did not call the front desk, because I was running around almost the whole time I was in Philadelphia, but that''s exactly why I wanted to come back to a tidied room. This is an oversight I did not expect from such a great chain. 

The Monaco included all of the amazing features of a Kimpton hotel. My dog was warmly greeted everywhere we went in the hotel, her dog bed and bowls were already in the room, and the decor was, as always, remarkable, interesting, and quirky. The staff was unbelievably friendly and helpful, and the complimentary drinks in the morning and for happy hour don''t hurt!

Overall, probably one of the best places to stay in Philadelphia. It''s a new hotel, so I''m sure the housekeeping issue will be addressed in time. Just growing pains."

Even though it was pretty crowded they moved through the waist list quickly.  I was a little surprised to be offered a drink, but quickly noticed that this must be a big selling point for them as most women were sipping on adult beverages.  I declined refreshments and was promptly handed info on more expensive options for my pedi.  Unlike other places in other states I had gone they did not do the massage of my calves with lotion or use the hot towel on my legs.  As soon as you go to the dry station they hound you for immidate payment.  The last time I went was the last straw.  They are already $5 more than the other salons for a basic pedi, but apparently I chose a color of polish that costs $5 more than the others making my 20 minute pedi $30 before tip.  The polish was not smooth started chipping in 2 days.  I will not return."

Ours was located on the 5th floors right next to the elevator with a very small window overlooking the court yard. It smelled like a basement. The only positive things I can say was the pillows were fantastic and the lady who came for turn down service was very sweet. 
I think this hotel needs to instill some sort of quiet hours if it wants to set themselves in the genre of classy. Having drunk frat guys making there presence know at all hours of the night is ridiculous. 
I also found out after our stay that my husband had requested a bottle of champagne to the room that was never brought. When he questioned it at check out the lady at the front desk was very rude and dismissive. 
I will never stay here again and I will recommend to my friends the same."

Strong cuban, if maybe a wee bit dry.  It might be just a bit too big -- you''ll be satisfied with the mini and a bag of plantain chips.  Next time, I''m going to try the chorizo.  Spanish chorizo is terrific, and the extra fat in the meat may help with the moist quotient.

Still, great shop, very cool owners, and well worth the trip to Broad Ripple!"

You probably wouldn''t notice the place unless you were looking for it, but it''s less of a dive inside than you would think, i.e. chain-fast-food-restaurant-style chairs and tables that are anchored to the ground and commercial signs designating the soda and salsa bars.

We ordered two tacos each, with the beans/rice/drink combo as well. We probably should have split one of the combo plates as the walk home was a bit more of a waddle. The fish tacos were decent, but I''ve had better. 
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VeFfrEZ4iWaecrQg6Eq4cg?select=-cSzA1ONPpzJcj_GkQ2Eow

The fish itself didn''t have much flavor so most of the taco''s taste came from the toppings. I''d try a burrito next time. The beans and rice were fine, but the cheese shreddings on top seemed unmeltable! Throughout the whole meal they maintained their waxy shredded-cheese shape. Ah well!

Ordered the Lobster Risotto w/ shrimp and lobster. There was about 3 pieces of lobster total in the dish, but the taste was well rounded and creamy. It was filling, adequately satisfying and nothing special.

What saved this from being a 2-star review was the fact that I tried my friend''s Straw and Hay, which was stellar. The toasted ravioli is also one-of-a-kind: not a cheese bomb like other places and extremely balanced in taste. They weren''t stingy with the filling, either. I''d probably have to come back and try other dishes, but all in all, I was salty about the waiting time."

Last time I was there I asked for some avocado and they gave me a whole one that was sliced and *perfectly* ripe and I think they only charged me a dollar. It costs more than that in the grocery store! 

One thing to watch out for is that the food does take a little bit of time to prepare. Not so long that I get impatient, but a tiny bit longer than a standard restaurant. So if you want it on your lunch break, make sure to order in advance and get it to go! :)

Most mornings the drive-thru service is so backed up it blocks traffic on Bloomingdale.  The traffic pattern within the property where the location sits is horrible.  Also the service, while my expectations are not high, is extremely slow and often incorrect.

This location is also not owned or operated by Dunkin corporate either, so if you have a problem that management does not resolve at this location, no one at corporate can do anything for you, you are just SOL.

I won''t even go here to buy my beans anymore they have messed up that much, DD does have great coffee, but this place can mess that up to and has.  Bad management, no pride of work, and just not worth the time and money."

The show is a little pricey but it goes to a good cause and it's neat to be in a space with so much history. Go if you can and be ready to stand! You can also buy tickets online that are more expensive but they reserve a seat for you if standing isn't your thing. Also I think the first 30 folks or so in line got seats as well.

Of course, the hotel remains in construction which is an inconvenience, but manageable. The front desk is located on the tenth floor which makes it difficult to get help quickly. Room floors are inaccessible without a room key in the elevator. This wouldn''t be an issue had the keys actually worked half the time (we had to get 5 new room keys). The elevators come once per hour and are almost always full, so you might as well get some exercise and take the stairs. The pool seemed too vacant (probably because the front desk was right in front of it). The rooms were quaint as they served their purpose, a place to sleep. Definitely not luxurious, but towels/soap were always cleaned and replaced. Our AC unit was faulty and we had to call for the hotel engineers to be fixed, but it remained operational after. Overall, horrible service and facility, but the rooms themselves are adequate. Location''s great, in the heart of the French Quarter.

There was a lovely duo playing during our dinner and it was nice that we were able to enjoy the music and still have a conversation. 
A few tips if you have never been here before:
- Make sure you have a reservation or be subject to dine/stand at the bar.
- Even with a reservation, you are instructed to complete your dining within 90 minutes of being seated. Understandable.

ejEVU5o5F56e7XIO07xpcA,Fox & Hounds Tavern,6300 Clayton Rd,Saint Louis,MO,63117,86,bfhg82P-td1Wuk-_-ZnheA,4,"We took a group to Fox & Hounds after reading they were serving hot cider by the fireplace!  We informed the waitress we were looking for the hot cider and wanted to sit by the fireplace.  She showed us the indoor area which is pretty small but very cozy (it would be great in the winter!), she took us out to the poolside terrace which had cabana areas with one fire pit where someone was sitting.  We were extremely disappointed.  

The waitress offered to take us to the courtyard area and have someone start a fire over there for us.  I thought this was extremely accommodating!  So we opted for a table in the courtyard and someone came to build us our own fire!

The waitress then told us that the kitchen didn''t know anything about the cider but they had called the head chef and we''re going to make it for us.  I thought it was very strange they would advertise something and then not even know about it, but I think they made up for it by making sure we still got it.

I actually ordered wine and a few of the guys ordered beer.  The other members of our party ordered the cider and it came with a splash of rum in a cute little tea cup with a saucer!

Among the group we ordered; bangers and mash (came out cold and we sent it back), the liverpool wings (which the guys said were good and they looved the new castle sauce), the burger, the pulled chicken sandwich, fish and chips and a few orders of fries.  So we basically sampled most of the menu and the only items we as group really liked were the wings and fries.  I''m not sure if the restaurant is new and needs some practice or what the deal is but the food needs some work.    

I love the place for it''s charm and character.  The service and the drinks were good!  Definitely don''t come hungry like we did.  I would recommend coming for drinks only or nightcaps after your belly is full!  It''s a great ambiance if you want to sit and enjoy a fire!"

They brought a full french press of coffee just what I needed to start the meal. The server was not as attentive as I would have liked and I had to ask for water several times. But the hostess/manager was very friendly and chatted with us for a bit. The pace of the meal was perfect long enough to digest and enjoy between courses.  The setting is beautiful it feels very retro with the old fans, tin roofs, and dark wood. The boudin noir was delicious. Followed by crawfish bisque with stuffed crawfish which taste perfectly seafoody with a hint of spices very subtle layered flavors. The Gumbo was also very good. I had beef short rib were tender but the presentation was a bit weak. The other meals were more of visual masterpieces. The crabmeat omelet was delicious and the home made fries were perfect. The grits were very creamy.and the pan fried trout was fabulous. This a really great place to come to try out John Besh food on without the hefty price tag."

We stopped by to see the hotel, but didn''t stay there as guests. This place wasn''t really near any downtown things, but we rented a car so it was no big deal to get there. (If you''re flying in for a weekend, I really recommend renting a car- I have no idea how we would have gotten around otherwise.) 

Parking was outrageously expensive so we parked in some shopping center across the street and walked in. It was maybe a 10 minute walk, but you''re mostly walking through nicely manicured Opryland foliage so it''s a nice walk.

The hotel was a sight to behold- HUGE glass ceilings, indoor river, many, many restaurants inside which had an outdoor feel because of the massive atrium. We took a boat ride given by Delta River Boat Tours which was a cute little boat on a track in their indoor river with a sweet southern tour guide letting us in on all the fascinating facts about the hotel. She told everything as if it was the most amazing fact that had ever left her lips: Here we have the original interior wall of the hotel... it was built in NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN! (So old!) or, our favorite, Here in the hotel we have an INDOOR SWIMMING POOL, so that you can swim ALL YEAR ROUND (You mean, INSIDE the building? Impossible!) 

Anyway, it was hilarious. Seems like a nice place just to see/have a drink/ maybe dinner if prices aren''t insane. Extra star for our tour guide who we still laugh about."

The prices are a bit high, but most items are imported or hard to find, so it''s kind of understandable. I think we drooled over the bakery section for about 20 minutes -- everything looked AMAZING! nice place to find unusual ingredients, and really fresh meat and seafood."

My wife is very skeptical of places like this, but she decided to give it a try with me.  We both ordered kebabs one lamb and one chicken.  
I lived overseas in college, and would eat authentic kebabs regularly, so I know what to expect.  
My wife and I shared our meals and she absolutely fell in love with kebabs! 

Great place and the owner seemed genuine, I would recommend this place all day long!"

The new tortellini appetizer was very good. Very good lasagna and chicken parm.

Dinner:
GREAT happy hour, we had 3 dozen oysters. The place was clean, efficient, and really good. Shawn (female) was on the ball!
Pros:
Happy hour drink prices. Oysters were divine (I had the P&J)
Cons:
I ordered the express, which was rabbit sausage with mustard sauce and noodles...mediocre at best.

Breakfast:
Service was slow as Hell compared to the night. Everyone around us was getting agitated
Pros:
Eggs in a jar was so unique I actually took a photo of it.
Cons:
Menu was tiny, a mimosa special would help this place out."

QWBBEFlGOtND_ldvmKdprA,Radnor Veterinary Hospital,107 N Aberdeen Ave,Wayne,PA,19087,54,HDMkmSCAGaUD8WIojTp6SA,5,"I cannot fathom why the reviews for this veterinary practice are so low. 

Birds are very good at hiding their symptoms and can be stubborn patients. I have two and I wouldn''t let anyone treat them besides Dr. Ehrlich. 

One of my little guys is getting up there in age and started having seizures and problems with his feet. My last vet thought the seizures were nothing to worry about, but Dr. Erlich knew better. She diagnosed him based on my description of his symptoms and a simple exam. She confirmed with a blood test that took only twenty minutes to return results.

Radnor Veterinary Hospital offered us a same-day appointment. Check-in was quick, and we were seen on time. Dr. Erlich spent a solid 30 minutes with us, explaining her diagnosis and her recommended treatment. She ran the test for us while we waited. And I do not feel I was overcharged for Radnor''s services. 

My primary care doctor will only see me same-day if I''m having an emergency. After arriving on time at her office, I usually wait 30-60 minutes before I''m taken to an exam room. My doctor has never spent more than 15 minutes with me. Radnor Veterinary Hospital is so good, I''d be treated there myself if I could."

After trying out many sushi restaurants in Nashville, i have finally found my favourite place for sushi! Their menu is 90% sushi and the other 10% is miso soup, gyzoa and various salads, no bento boxes, udon, donburi etc. Place is old and out dated but didnt bother me because it reminded me of most jap restaurants at home, my partner however noticed a unusual scent and the fact that they needed to renovate the place a little. We had the gyoza has a starter and it was delicious! My partner had the California, rock & roll and crunch shrimp roll. 
I had spicy tuna(raw), spicy crab and crab with fried shrimp roll. I was reluctant to try the more tradtional sushi or nigiri as i have been let down so so so many times so i decided to order rolls that i wouldnt regret so much later on lol 
 Everything was amazing!! Couldnt believe how great every roll tasted. My fave was the spicy tuna roll, it was fresh and how it should be made. Our waiter was nice and attentive. I am done searching, this is now my go to place for sushi. Cant wait to try the rest of the menu! Together with a green tea & sprite our bill came to $44 just another reason to return!!!!"

When the weather is nice, you can go out on the patio which is nice because I''m an occasional smoker.  There''s a bar out there and they even have a huge tv they roll out.

However, I had a couple of problems with the professionalism of the staff which is why I rated three stars instead of five. I can''t help but make this personal and say that I wasn''t treated with equal warmness and courtesy because of my appearance. Coming from a red eye flight, I arrived at the hotel with sweatpants and frazzled hair. I do have tattoos and I''m in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, Who let you in? look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it''s the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn''t awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies. Just because someone is young and underdressed and has tattoos does not make them less worthy of respect. My money is as good as anyone else''s."

It''s standard McDonald''s food, so I won''t other with a description. I happen to love their fries and like their cheeseburgers and a couple of the breakfast sandwiches. 

Service has varied from so-so to good---but usually toward the good end of the scale---and the speed has been from slow to super-fast. My one problem with this McDonald''s location is not getting straws or not getting napkins when the drive-thru is busy and the workers are rushing; so do check your bag(s) after you leave the window.

Seriously, it''s been in limbo since the spring time. What took so long? I guess, as the saying goes, you have to wait for the good things in life.

Anyways, we had a little reunion with one of my buddies from out of town and went to check out Lee House''s latest digs. The place was pretty packed for a Wednesday evening and is split into two different areas, the left side more compact with smaller tables while the right side is for bigger groups of families and friends. The restaurant has a very spacious, open air feeling and they clearly put a lot of time and effort into making things look great. I was hoping that they would put more of their focus on Korean BBQ, as Edmonton is seriously lacking a good place. We shall see, I''m sure things will change when they finish renovating their original Whyte Ave shop.

While we were waiting for my buddy to show up, we perused the menu which has quite the variety of options. We decided to try several of their BBQ options but sadly, we didn''t even get to grill any meat. Sad face. Also, I have to mention service was pretty weak, even for an Asian restaurant. We could barely hear when the waitress told us what our dishes were, had to ask for tea several times, and it was hard to flag down someone to take our order. I''m sure it will get better once they settle in.

We ordered:
- Banchan and rice bowls - the banchan were all good, especially the bean sprouts and spinach. I just wish they brought out more/re-filled them during our meal.
- Bibimbap ($10.95) - steamed rice topped with vegetables (carrots, spinach, zucchini, daikon, bean sprouts) over a lightly fried egg.  They brought out the Korean chili paste in a separate bottle, so you can add as much as you want. The bibimbap was decent but nothing to write home about. 
- Jap chae bokeum ($11.95) - potato noodles with mixed vegetables, black fungus mushroom in a sweet soy mushroom sauce. This dish was perfectly done! Noodles had the perfect chew. I think I just love noodles. Someone teach me how to make this at home.
- Bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced beef marinated in a sweet soy garlic sesame sauce. 
- Spicy pork loin bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet onion, garlic chili paste. Slightly spicy, full of flavour, this was my favourite bulgogi dish of the night.
- Sweet ginger pork bulgogi ($14.95) - sliced pork loin marinated in a sweet ginger sesame soy. I didn''t get too much ginger flavour from this one, but it was still quite tasty.

So to sum up, first visit (of what I''m sure will be many) was pretty good. Lots of interesting items to lure you back. We''ll have to make sure next time we try out their other BBQ items and do some grilling! I''m impressed with all the good Korean restaurants in town - make sure to add this one to your list of must try."

The parking lot had several cars with people living in them, as well as the lot next door (I think it was a Home Depot).  I did not feel safe outside of the hotel - while I typically don''t mind walking a dog or two by myself during daylight hours, I was extremely uncomfortable with the area.  We had planned to stay there on our way back from our trip as well, but we opted to stay a few miles east in Greenfield at a very quiet, clean, new Holiday Inn Express that didn''t have this issue."

As someone who eats meat, I had doubts about trying it initially since it''s a 100% vegetarian but I was pleasantly surprised and now I''m hooked! 

I love the feel of this place -- it''s very charming. It''s pretty small so I recommend that you make a reservation especially if you plan to go on a Friday or Saturday evening. Please also note that it''s BYOB and the dessert menu changes occasionally. 

The adobo goat cheese nachos are a must try! I also recommend the black bean soup, the mediterranean sampler, the blue corn asparagus tacos, and the falafel wrap. 

The only dish which I''m not fond of is the wild mushroom risotto."

My suit wouldn''t have looked good with the one clean Roots Canada T-shirt I had left, so I headed off to Perlis to find myself a white button-down for dinner at Commander''s Palace.

Perlis was everything a proper men''s clothing store should be. A gentleman in an impeccable suit helped me find the perfect French cuff American-made shirt. When I mentioned my dilemma, he had their in-house seamstress steam and press the shirt for me at no charge.

Helping me find the perfect shirt would be enough reason to go back, but going above and beyond to really save the day makes me want to wax poetic about this place."

* I have a bit of a sour attitude toward beef and lamb mixed and grilled together. Every time I had it as a young man, it tasted... gamey. Smelled somewhat like moist dog food.
* It''s been years of avoiding gyros, until tonight. I had some time to wait here in this area, so maybe it was time to revisit the gyro from a place that seems to know what they''re doing.
* Yeah. This sauce was good enough to almost make me not notice what meat I was eating. It didn''t taste bad at all. I don''t think it''s something I will make a regular meal, as I am sensitive to dairy/cheese."

I was told by a girl that cut my hair that they have the best gluten-free bread and buns she has ever tasted. She said they were so good, that she ate six buns in a row. I was excited, when I heard this, because Kinnikinnick''s bread is not very good. It''s like eating bricks, and it took me years to get used to it; not to mention, it only really tastes good when it''s toasted. 

I''ve tried Breadland''s arrowroot gluten-free buns. These are indeed very good. They are very soft and the outside is chewy, and they taste great with just about anything: butter, hummus, melted cheese, or peanut butter & jam. The only problem is that I can''t eat them, because they give me really bad eczema on my face. I suspect it''s all the yeast they put in it. The focaccia gluten-free bread they sell is also really good. This is like a thick flat bread that is flavoured with tons of herbs and I think some garlic too. It''s so good, and although it contains yeast, I don''t get eczema, so it must not be that much. 

These breads are very expensive though, so I only get them as a treat."

I have been to other corner bakery cafes, and I usually like them, but I tend to get terrible service at this one. These problems manifests as long waits for meals even during slow times, and getting orders wrong.
The last time (never again) I went in it was a slow morning, and it took them 45 minutes to get me my eggs, and when they came they were cold. I informed the cashier that my eggs were cold and I asked him if they could make me new eggs.  He said yes, and took my eggs.  He came back out with my same plate, and it was evident that he microwaved the plate with the toast and fruit on it; the toast was soggy, and fruit warm.

The prices are reasonable. Their food is only okay though. I''ve had their sandwiches a few times. My biggest gripe is I do not like their tomatoes. I think they freeze them and as a result they are always a little hard. I could be wrong about the reason, but they are hard none-the-less.

They also have a few pre-made hot items. The hot dogs are okay. But it''s hard to mess up a hot dog. They hot breakfast sandwiches and snack items are below average. Cheap and quick but so not worth it.

Go hear for a candy bar, drink, or other package snack item. Don''t go here for anything that''s actually prepared by them. It''s just not that good."

Upon walking in, we were greeted kindly by a man, who we never saw again. We sat and waited, checking out their menu. The waitress/bartender came up and asked if we were ready to order, but since part of our party was missing, we asked if we could have a few minutes. Well, I guess a few minutes means twenty because our waitress sat at a table conversing with a couple instead of coming back to assist us. The whole place was rather dead, probably since it was the day before Thanksgiving. Finally, she came over to take our orders. She was helpful in telling us what to avoid on the menu. We got margaritas all around. I had a mango margarita (I tried it both on the rocks and blended) and it was absolutely delicious! I would return just for their fabulous Mango margarita. I heard both their strawberry and traditional margaritas were just as good as well! (Just a tip, avoid the banana margarita!) It took our waitress forever to check on us again and we ended up going up to the bar anytime we needed something. We didn''t even think about ordering food, considering the service we were receiving wasn''t ideal. The drinks were good and our waitress was polite, just not very attentive. I still enjoyed my experience here and would consider coming back! Infact, I see another mango margarita in my future."

A duster restaurant to burg bar & grill, this gem had a ton of breakfast and lunch options with some added Greek flare and a touch of Cuban dishes. To this native Floridian it''s the fun options you''d expect to see at a local diner. 

I got the mama mias eggs Benedict which included spinach and mushrooms. I selected crispy hash browns as my side and it also came with a banana and strawberry. It was so good I wish there was less hollandaise since it was so good it didn''t need that much. 

The guys got the Hungry Greek and an omelet and we were all happy. Choices between potatoes, hash browns and grits ensured there were options for everyone.  A banana and strawberry for everyone too.  

Portions were large, prices good and the choices abundant.

BWPokhrYnWdfxdaUaM6l9Q,Nashville Symphony,1 Symphony Pl,Nashville,TN,37201,107,hckjA9TzEJRDNIEpcRNVtA,5,"Walking up upon the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, you can''t help to marvel at the beauty of the statues and facade. The classic Romanesque architecture is as compelling in size as its design. 

For my first symphony, I attended the free yearly symphony this past Saturday. Having a deep understanding of modern and contemporary music; my sense of audio innocence for this show provided a pure experience. 

During the first piece, I was overwhelmed by the senses of emotion from the insight into sounds surreal. Each successive song brought me to a different state of emotion. Sadness and pain - comfortableness - excitement and joy.

The acoustics of the hall are simply and totally consuming. You feel completely surrounded by sound. Although we sat directly center of the stage, we noticed that the balcony''s were also reacting in applause in a similar manner. I bet the view from there is more amazing. You could then see each musician as they added their contribution to the influence over your feelings.

Walking around the outside gardens, you really begin to notice the architecture. There are flowers and fountains adorning many areas of the facility. 

Its without saying, you must consider attending a symphony here once in your life. I still have little knowledge about who wrote what; the name of the piece/song/tune. However, I do know that the experience rivaled nearly every concert I have attend. And I have: There are many shows under my belt. 

There was a new appreciation and connection to sound that I left with that transforming evening..."

The Mall is right next door so we took advantage of the beautiful weather and walked over. There are a ton of great restaurants right near the hotel as well as the IMAX movie theater.

We were on a family vacation from Arkansas as this is one of the closest locations to us. The menu was confusing as they have fresh fish on the menu but if it does not have a checkmark beside it they do not currently have it. I wanted halibut but there was no checkmark. So I asked the waitress for a recommendation. She recommended the snapper dish. So I ordered that. Then the server came back to tell me the snapper was still frozen solid. The chef recommended I get the red fish but I did not want that. So I got the swordfish.  It was good but I was disappointed.  The waitress was friendly and took good care of us. I said well get me a discount since you didn't have what I wanted. No discount and no manager came out to apologize for not having dishes ready to go for a Friday lunch. We will probably come back but are disappointed in this trip to one of our favorite restaurants. You would think they would have better customer service and have all menu items prepped for the weekend!

When we saw they had only moved we had to try them out in their new down town location. I don''t the know owners name but he is the nicest guy. Very friendly. The food was delicious but it might have been wise for us to confirm what we thought we were ordering. Indian food is delicious but I am horrible at remembering what I ordered before. Unfortunately this review is another victim of my not being able to remember the names of what we ordered. One dish was mostly spinach (a total hit), another was some red chicken dish (perfectly cooked but looked like it was dyed red), and naan which is everyone''s favorite. If you know your Indian dishes you won''t be disappointed. Kids are always welcome there. Be sure to enjoy downtown while you''re there."

The Good- as mention the interior is amazing, makes you want to back and relax all night long. Fish and chips was solid.

The Bad- Soooo... I have never had to eat a burger with a knife and fork... why did I have to do that you may ask? (See pic) the bun was so dry it crumbled into dust as I held it and took a bite. It was brioche bun that was way dry and appeared to have an egg wash on it which just made matters worse. I will say the burger meat, with bacon and English cheddar if eaten all at the same time was great, though burger meat by itself needed season.  

The Ugly- the coleslaw straight up had turned, it smelled like rotting vegetables in fishy water and tasted the same. I literally spit it out it was that bad.

I am sadly seeing a food quality issue here, borderline need health inspectors to visit on that coleslaw.

Also side note if they had more local craft beers other then 2-3 on draft, an extensive bourbon list this would make a killer spot for drinks and drinks only until food quality is resolved. Wishful thinking as well but would be great if this was a cigar bar as the atmosphere is prime for that.

PS- other people bitched about pricing but we felt it was very inexpensive. $51 for 2 meals, 3 drinks.

I really hope they make some of these suggested changes sooo much potential for go to spot."

It wasn''t very busy at the time so we were seated right away. Our waitress was extremely friendly and told us to check out the specials they were offering. We ordered Bloody Marys and Mimosas and they were delicious! I especially enjoyed the Bloody Mary. 

We ordered the fried green tomatoes eggs benedict and crab cake eggs benedict. They were both so delicious. The crab cakes were huge and full of delicious crab! The poached egg was perfect, I literally almost licked my plate clean. The home fries on the side were super amazing too, the seasoning on it was just enough and had the perfect crunch. My boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his fried green tomatoes as well. I was able to get a quick bite and I can see why!

Back end was 2 stars, because entrees took very long and were unimpressive. Flavor was good but short on some ingredients. The veal special was just a breaded fried veal cutlet; no cheese, no sauce. Pappardelle with pork had almost no pork; tasted fine though. Chocolate hazelnut tort dessert took very long to expedite and preparation was inconsistent. We ordered 3 - there were 5 of us at the table - and one came with chocolate shavings, while 2 did not. One was also stuck to the plate and the crust was like stone.

They did comp us on the dessert, which was very nice considering the wait.

The service was satisfactory. It wasn''t the best I ever had, but it was not as bad as some of the other places I dealt with in the French Quarter. So I guess it was okay to say the least.

One of the other things I like about this place is the unusual amounts of homeless wino''s that pass out in front of this place. I kind of understand that this is the norm on Bourbon street. But it is comical to see a bum passed out in front of an upscale place like this. This place is really pricey, but given the fact it is an upscale place on bourbon street I totally understand why.

In short good food, mediocre service, pricey establishment and a magnet for drunks to pass out in front of!"

I gotta admit im embarrassed, I had been to this bar 4 times before I realized there was an outside patio.  That only made this place a 1000 times better.

I been here when it was a quiet night, maybe a little early and everyone (6 people) was at the inside bar watching Jackass2.5     I been here when it was so crowded , I wished everyone was a big fan of deodorant as I am.   Either way, everytime I came, I had a great time.

Im more of a beer drinker than anything so I cant comment on the mixed drinks but by the looks of it, they appeared to be pretty stiff.

The beer selection is decent too.  On tap is nice, Blue Moon, Magic Hat, Abitas to name a few.

The music they play when a DJ is in has varied greatly.  Walked in once and they were jamming to Reggae,  another time it was a Cure night and the most recent, we were bouncing along to some NOLA Clap.    I havent been here for a metal night, but im looking forward to it.

Whenever I get ready for a trip, researching ice cream shops is at the top of my to-do list. I don''t care if it''s the dead of winter. You take coffee breaks? I take ice cream breaks. I realize that I take this obsession/addiction to an unhealthy extreme, as I''ve been known to eat it for dinner. 

With that said, you can imagine that I was really excited to try this place since it is so highly rated on yelp. When reading the reviews, I was convinced that Creole Creamery was going to be the Bi-rite of the south (best ice cream I''ve ever had). I had some pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, it did not deliver quite like I thought it would but it certainly wasn''t bad. 

My main problem is that out of the 3 flavors I had, THEY ALL TASTED IDENTICAL. I got the Basil Coconut & Lavender and my sister got the Rose. These were some of the most unique flavors they offered and you''d think they''d be pretty distinguishable from one another. Alas, neither of us could taste much difference. The flavors were extremely subtle.

What I did love however was the creaminess and texture. This is where it gets close to the Bi-Rite status. The ice cream itself is very rich and smooth with perfect consistency. You simply can''t buy something like this in the store. Had the flavors wowed me, I would have given this 5 stars, hands down (and it truly would have become the Bi-Rite of the South in my book).

All in all, I will definitely go back. I mean, it''s still great ice cream. And I''m sure if I tried a more traditional flavor, the taste would be stronger. I just really love the weird stuff :)"

I''ve had lunch here several times and never had a bad choice.  Today, I opted for the Homewrecker:  a big, honkin'' flour burrito crammed full of steak, black beans, rice, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole, cheese and pico de gallo (also available with pork, ground beef, chicken or tofu.)  All ingredients are fresh and packed with great flavor.

 - always a GREAT burrito...among the very best I''ve ever had!  (and filling, too!)  Also, their chips are made fresh and have a good flavor and crispness.  Finally, I like the choices of spicy and mild salsas.

Just two nits:

 - Salsa service.  I HATE having to fill three or four small containers to meet my needs.  I''d prefer to have a choice of a larger container.  Also, the area is too small to permit you to comfortably set your meal and drink down while dispensing without fear of being nudged by another or passing customer.  More elbow room in the salsa area would be great.

- Cleanliness.  It seems that the tail-end of the lunch hour gets greeted with a bit of a mess on the floors beneath the booths.

What Mexican restaurant can''t make a good margarita??  Each of our meals was boring and unauthentic.

When we tried to use our $3 off $15 coupon we were told we couldn''t use it.  Really?  After spending almost $50 on three regular margaritas and two entrees (no appetizers and no desserts and yes it cost that much).   Extremely overpriced, poor service, boring food."

There are some perks, if you live nearby it''s of course convenience.  The other nice perk is that Lancaster brand steaks are very good and at this Acme they''re always fresh, good grill cuts, and they are very reasonably priced."

The arroz con pollo I ordered came to my table artfully arranged on my plate.  And it was delicious, as was every part of my order.

Why the two stars?  As it seems others know all too well, the service was abysmal.  On one occasion, we waited interminably for a table, only to find out that the waiter thought we were part of another party, when there had been two seats available the whole time!  

Once we were served, the waitstaff ignored us.

This place seriously needs a management shakeup.  It needs a better manager, and a dedicated hostess/outside manager."

Last time we go.... just isn''t worth $47 for three adult tickets, then my wife and I have to run the theater too.  I will start with arrival, an irritated bartender, upset customers asking for help, getting eye rolls from employee, then once the movie started, had to tell same irritated bartender to have someone turn off the bright lights in the movie theater, the movie has been running for 5 minutes already, had to change out soda twice, both were flat, with very little syrup.  screen was dark, no surround sound on. All in all, was a great place at one time, now, just drive by, you will be glad you did.  It was obvious no management or any sense of concern for the customer. What a joke!"

Nick, the owner, was eating at one of the tables and would get up and help the staff and check on the customers.  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall cleanliness of the restaurant.  I had the house omelet. The Greek inspiration for this omelet was a pleasant change from the normal omelets served in most breakfast places. Yes, they do call their fries Freedom fries.

The room was clean and the bed was comfortable,  the room also had a microwave and a fridge.

We visited on a night when there weren''t very crowded so it was nice to be able to have such an attentive waitress and service.  I was a bit disappointed when I didn''t find as much on the menu as I would have liked to have seen that would appeal to me.  I guess I have become very picky with my Yelp addiction in terms of scrutinizing every establishment I go to pretty thoroughly.  

I ordered the hummus appetizer for the table and was very pleased at the quality of the dish.  For my entree I ordered their Bricks Salad which had plenty of fresh produce packed in.  I ordered a double portion of chicken for it, which still seemed pretty skimpy especially since I was charged for that request.  Overall, I''d say this is probably one of Ybor''s lesser known spots as its more on the western edge of the main strip, yet it seems very lively and upbeat.  I did like that they had featured lots of artwork by various local artists that were on display and offerred for sale.  Not a bad place to hang out and have a drink if you''re looking for a lower key outing in the Ybor area."

It''s currently under construction for a remodel but the exhibit is untouched. 
The stories of survivors as well as their relatives is displayed very well. Family pictures show so much detail of how people lived before the holocaust. I was so sad to see the evidence of how blind people were to the atrocities that the Jews faced during this time. 
They showed how many different groups were enslaved by the Nazi regime for being different. 
I hope more people will visit this museum and learn how easily and quickly hate can change and ruin lives. 
In my opinion, everyone should see this exhibit. Highly recommended."

The sitting area was a nice, comfortable size with a table, 2 chairs, sofa, coffee table & TV plus a kitchenette with a microwave, small fridge, dishwasher, coffee maker & a small assortment of dishes.

Room was very comfortable & clean, hotel was clean and was also very conveniently located. City center, Reading Terminal etc was only a 5-10 min walk and the Liberty Bell area was only a 15-20 min walk (with children in tow).

Its been some time since I have frequented this restaurant, I stopped going for sometime because the food became very inconsistent.

Fast forward to today, i decided to stop by since some years had passed.  I ordered the ox tail and jerk chicken wings...  I just have to say that i was VERY disappointed. The oxtail though tender was very small and full of fat... more fat than meat and small portions at that...the rice was stale.  But what was really disappointing was the jerk wings.. I took one bite and ended up spitting out the chicken..  I just couldn''t believe that an establishment would serve this....i assume no one in the kitchen samples the food before it comes out... they just cant... there is no way someone could think its okay to serve such dry tasteless food.

The sausage gravy was very tasty as was the orange juice.  I didn''t enjoy the biscuits.  They were very hard and smothering them in gravy didn''t help much.

I''d cut the woman some slack if I saw a doctor''s note certifying that she was really mute, but she wasn''t sharing.  Her response to us ordering was sighing and rolling her eyes.  WTF?  The good thing was,  I was not here to make friends.  I came here with one purpose in life - to slay a mighty roast beef n gravy Po Boy.  It was just what I wanted and more.  So good.  Sweet potato fries are bomb, too.  Good selection of Abita.  Hush puppies were whatever.  Kinda tasteless and underwhelming.  Bread pudding was amazing.

We dined here last night, and were very happy. The ambiance and interior design are top notch. It''s very impressive how the space has been transformed from the previous tenant. The food was outstanding, which is unsurprising considering the chef''s pedigree. We had two lovely cocktails and a whole fish that was perfectly cooked along with a terrific short rib play on stroganoff. The only reason I''m not giving five stars is that those cocktails and two entrees ended up costing $140. The Love is really good, but it''s also surprisingly expensive. Entrees are priced in the $30-$40 range and appetizers and pastas are not far behind. The Love bills itself as a neighborhood restaurant, and it would be, perhaps, the platonic ideal of that if the prices dropped by a third. As is, it''s as expensive as any non-tasting menu restaurant in Philly. Is that worth it when you can eat for less up the block at Vernick, etc? I''m not totally sure.

There are so many delicious flavors to try and it''s usually hard to choose just one.  However, over time and many flavor tests I find that I tend to gravitate to chocolate flavors. My personal favorites at the Creole Creamery are the entire chocolate section  (located on your left as soon as you walk in); more specifically, the chocwork-orange (a dark creamy chocolate ice cream with a hint of orange flavor), the butterscotch english toffee (soooo good) and lavender honey (who doesn''t love lavender?)

Our favorite dish is the chicken parmigiana, which is unbelievably delicious.  The portions are plentiful for the price, you will almost certainly get two meals out of it.  The vodka sauce is excellent and matched by their red sauce.  Their pasta is always perfect.

I would be remiss if I didn''t mention the freshly baked rolls, which really stand out on their own (we must ALWAYS bring a bag home to have with the leftovers), and bruschetta which whets the appetite before every dinner.

Every meal here is exceptional. The servers are great. Go here if you are hungry for Italian and you will never be disappointed."

I just got home after ordering takeout and I ordered the buffalo grilled chicken wrap. Well it''s only grilled chicken minus the buffalo sauce. Not a big deal, but for the life of me, I can''t seem to get a to-go order that is right when I leave this place. I blame the cook not doing his or her job and lack of management oversight. 

I think I''ve given up on to-go orders here."
8uF-bhJFgT4Tn6DTb27viA,District Donuts Sliders Brew,2209 Magazine St,New Orleans,LA,70130,2062,VZFTuroLrItC9aLzXtMPfw,5,"Truly one of the places where your eyes are bigger than your stomach. And even so you wish your stomach could double its capacity. 

The donuts here are imaginative and original. I had to come here as soon as it opened to grab some coffee and sample their daily selection of donuts before my seminar started in the morning. 

New Orleans is known for the buttermilk drop and while I didn''t get a chance to try the one at Wink''s in the French Quarter, I imagine the ones at District are a good representation. It''s a cakey donut hole with sweet icing draped over it. Generally, I''m more a yeast donut fan but those buttermilk drops were delightful. I could have eaten a half dozen, no sweat. But there were other items to try. 

District has croquenuts available which is their version of a griddled donut sandwich. I chose the Monte Cristo for it''s sweet and savory combination. Gooey cheese and salty ham between a donut covered in powdered sugar with a hefty dollop of raspbery preserves nestled in the center of the donut. This was a magical creation. Get it if you have the chance.

Finally, to top of my donut extravaganza, I chose the Miso Olive Oil Praline Bacon donut. It''s a mouthful to say but wasn''t to consume. Such a fascination combination of flavors from this donut. I chose it mostly for the bacon but the miso, olive oil, and praline each hit their notes with every bite. Simply wonderful. 

Not to forget was the the Vietnamese Iced Coffee to wash it all down. It was the jolt I needed to wake me up for this early morning call for donuts. 

You bet I''ll make another (or several) stops next time I''m in New Orleans."

6I_DA3uqOox50rBvjrQ_-g,Aloft Philadelphia Airport,4301 Island Ave,Philadelphia,PA,19153,175,jeQijvSYFa5zA0dJuuDWXA,3,"Was in Philly this past weekend. I usually stay in Center City but all the hotels in the area were sold out because of the Equality Forum. I scored a decent rate of $120/night + tax through Expedia.

In any event, I enjoyed the overall vibe of the place. I checked in around 2:30pm. I was greeted by the handsome, energetic front desk clerk and directed to room 225.

While room 225 was definitely one of the larger rooms in the hotel, there''s a reason for that. It was a double room designed for someone who uses a wheelchair. I was only staying one night so I didn''t bother making a big fuss about it, but I did enjoy the larger size. Some of the accessibility extras, like everything being REALLY low for easier access, took some getting used to. The bathroom area was equally huge, with easy access to the sink and closet area, as well as a water closet and roll-in shower tucked behind a huge sliding door. The shower itself had one of those detachable shower heads as well as a gym-shower style dispenser with body wash and shampoo. 

As for the bed, other than being ridiculously low to the floor (again, for easier access for those in wheelchairs), it was pretty comfortable and I slept pretty soundly. The TV had a decent selection of HDTV channels. Complementary water and coffee was in the room, as well as a mini-fridge in the bathroom area in case you wanted to keep drinks or meds cool. 

The parking fee was $9 with in/out privileges. You had to get a new ticket every time you entered and the front desk would stamp it when you wanted to leave the lot. The lot is pretty large and shared with two other Sheraton properties (They also run a shared shuttle in case you''re going to or from the airport.).  

I took a quick look at the pool area. It was pretty empty but again, it''s early May and that''s to be expected, I guess. There''s not much choices for food onsite, other than a quick-service area that''s a tad overpriced (again, to be expected). You can drive north maybe 5 minutes on Island Avenue for fast food if you needed to. The bar area looked fun, but again, it was pretty empty for a Saturday.

All in all, if I had to stay outside of Center City Philadelphia again, I''d probably stay here. They really should put one of these in Center City, if you ask me. It''d be perfect."

It was crowded already but we were seated at the counter immediately. We started with the Bottomless Drip coffee and Apple Fritter donuts. Loved the donuts and the coffee''s flavor was solid, but it could have been hotter. Although, on the plus side, I didn''t have to wait for it to cool down before I could drink it. Our desert was followed by the cheesy blue corn grits with all the extras (I.e. a soft poached egg, scallions and bacon bits). I''m late to the grits game but I loved them. My lovely wife had the bialy (think bagel) and lox, and miso soup. She is more of a foodie than me and a chef to boot. She was quite pleased. Service was average to good. It was cool sitting at the  counter. We got to watch the chefs in action. There was a taller female that was very focused and professional, more than most. When she wasn''t cooking she was prepping and/or cleaning. Not sure why this wasn''t a five star rating, probably the average service. In the end we had a great dining experience.

This review is not about food, which is very good, but customer service. I came in a few minutes after closing, with people being served plates, just starting to dig in, not looking like they would leave any time soon. 

They wouldn''t seat me. They wouldn''t even do take out. I had wanted the special. They probably could have scooped it from the tray. No fuss no muss. I only get here twice a year now.

Someone greeted me as soon as I walked in, the guy who took my order was very friendly, and the person who cleared my table asked me if I needed a refill or was just in general very cheery.

Not too impressed with the food though. The cucumber salad was delicious, so make sure you order that as your side - but admittedly it''s a dish that''s kind of hard to screw up. The wrap I got tasted okay, but it tasted like it was made in a microwave (not sure, maybe it was). In general the food reminded me of a mediterranean version of Panera. I don''t like Panera either, so if you think the food there is awesome maybe you will like this place more than I did. The best way I can think to describe it is like the food you might get on a fancy mediterranean airline. It was edible and had some nice flavors, but just wasn''t great.

However, and a big however is the take-out experience. We opted to run downstairs from the hotel, cause the menu was bigger than room service. We ordered two soups, two salads, a dessert.....we got two salads, one soup, no utensils. When I called back, the lady seemed a bit skeptical. Really! So we ran back down for the missing items and alas still no utensils, soooo we ran back down again. Bothersome, unapologetic, and ended our eating there."

A friend was in town and after a day at Busch Gardens we were starved.  I remembered seeing Tsunami when  I was at the nearby Home Depot and the place looked appealing.  I checked the reviews on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  For a Holiday weekend it was crowded, but it didn''t take too long to get seated at a Hibachi table.  I have been a huge Benihana fan in the past and enjoy this style of restaurant.  I noticed there were a lot of drinks specials on the menu and the pricing seemed very reasonable compared to Benihana.  There was one guest at the table who had a lot of questions and special requests which took some time to get sorted out, but once she was accommodated, the service moved more quickly.  Not the servers fault.  The portions were huge!  I also didn''t expect to get noodles in addition to rice, but it made for some quality left overs the next day.  I ordered the shrimp, scallop and filet teppanyaki and like I stated prior the portions were generous, the fried rice was ok, just rice and egg, no veggies or proteins mixed in - pretty basic, but it was well seasoned.  I was impressed with the scallops and the shrimp and quality of the filet.  All was cooked properly, and the chef was entertaining and efficient.  While the reviews for Tsunami were mixed on Yelp, I would not hesitate to come back and bring friends.  It was an enjoyable experience and a good value."

The donuts looked overdone and loaded up with unnecessary ingredients at first, but I was wrong.  They were actually well balanced with good flavors.  They take coffee seriously too.  I tried their Cold Nitro Brew which seemed more like a Guinness than an iced coffee.  It wasn''t exactly my style (so switched it for a latte instead) but I applaud them for trying to innovate."

I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn''t surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn''t planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.  

I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn''t great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn''t that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don''t state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.  

If you''re a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it''s not very veggie friendly.  And don''t think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be politely declined as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn''t seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn''t sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle. 

They do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.  

I will say that the their menu has changed since they opened and a lot of what was mentioned in previous reviews is no longer on the menu."

The atmosphere is minimal and inviting. The bar is covered with a nice copper coating and has ample room for seating. The space itself is very open and offers plenty of sitting for more high volume times. The tap room features board games and darts - not a typical sight at a brewery. The bartenders were friendly and efficient. 

I had the Bailey''s Chocolate Oatmeal Stout - delicious! Has a great subtle bitterness, which I assume comes from the chocolate. The oatmeal rounds out the mouthfeel of this beer making it super palatable.

My man-friend had the 17 - an Imperial Stout with Chocolate & Mint. This beer is a home run! I rated it a 5 on UnTappd. Job well done!! Can''t wait to cellar one of the 750 ml we took home for a bit and explore this brew again.

They surveyed the work, explained the pricing again, and gave me the option to cancel.  They then went about their work quickly and efficiently - and even cleaned and swept when they were done.  It was a bit pricey - but it saved me hours of work and the hassle of dump runs and/or renting a dumpster.  They also told me that they recycle and donate as much as they can.

Literally that''s all I can say about this place. I went twice in one weekend! I''m literally obsessed. So where do I begin?

The doughssants! Or cronuts, as some people prefer. How YUMMY. I had the cranberry and coconut one. They''re very dense so get one BEFORE your meal bc I could only take one bite out of mine after I finished my grilled cheese. Oh man, that grilled cheese. They have a really unique blend of cheeses and pesto! Now I am not a pesto fan (I know, very strange) but it works great here! But the selling point is the tomato basil soup. Literally the BEST I have ever had and this is my favorite soup so I have tried it everywhere. The second time, I tried the classic breakfast: 2 eggs, any style (I opted for scrambled), country hash (delicious) and toast. This time I had my doughssant beforehand, s''mores flavored -- amazeballs. 

The space is very comfortable and beautifully decorated. The staff is extremely friendly always checking in with you and making light-hearted and sincere conversation. 

There is a wait to be seated. But you just have to stick it out because you don''t want to miss out on this new restaurant. 

I''ll be back when they get their liquor license business straightened out so I can sip on a mimosa while I enjoy my grilled cheese."

One positive: a variety of healthy smoothie options with fresh ingredients. I really appreciate the lack of added sugars or overuse of ice. However, my first experience far exceeded my most recent visit. The inconsistency in the smoothies makes me hesitant to return. I ordered the same smoothie on both visits. On my second visit, the employee admitted he didn''t know how to make all of the menu options; he could definitely use better training. I received a smoothie that likely had all of the listed ingredients, but the proportions of those ingredients were way off. My smoothie only tasted like lemon and celery. It was too sour to finish.  Considering South Tampa''s dedication to Xtreme Juice, I  doubt this place will last long given the inconsistency in the smoothies and lack of a BOGO option on Sundays."

This was our first experience. I feel the admission prices were fair ($24.95pp with AAA card). We spent 5 hours there so it was about $5/hr per person! We purchased a small locker that was large enough for my large purse, diaper bag, towels and our shoes. The place smelled strongly of chlorine, but it''s an indoor water park...that''s what it should smell like. The lines were moderately long, but it was a weekend and we knew what we were getting into when we planned the trip. The water temperatures and indoor temperatures were comfortable. The only thing I did not like was the mat that is in the food court area...it sort of hurts your feet if you are barefoot. We did not like waiting in a line to order food and then waiting in another line outside to pick it up, but we tolerated it. i don;t know why people are saying there are no tables and no shade....we sat at a table with shade and we ended up having to move because it was too shady. We purchased the bucket of chicken fingers and french fries for $30. There were way to many french fries and we had to walk the bucket to the car to keep it stored. If we put it in the locker, everything would''ve smelled like grease. The bucket should also be priced at $25 being that it is mostly french fries...or it should include fresh fruit/cookies. There is a wave pool as well and I don''t know why someone said there isn''t. We spent a lot of time in the wave pool as my kids loved it. There were lifeguards everywhere so safety wasn''t an issue. The trip was a huge success and I would love to upgrade to a season pass when my children are a little older and can ride everything."

Pastries (had the croissant, eclair, cannoli) are okay but nothing amazing. Dining area is small. Very limited drink options. I agree with previous reviews that it is very reminiscent of break-room coffee with 2 pump pots full of coffee and buy-in-bulk tea bags.  

Really what soured the experience was the counter staff.  After my SO and I purchased several pastries, coffee, tea and went to sit down, the staff informed us that we couldn''t stay because they were closing. The sign says 5pm, this was at 4pm.  She assured us that it was just that day they were closing early.   No apology. Just informed us and walked away. After all this, I had to remind her that I was still waiting for a cup of hot water to steep my warehouse earl grey tea in. We came to the cafe to sit and enjoy tea and pastries so it was obviously a disappointment to get kicked out before the advertised closing time.  I would have greatly appreciated being informed of the earlier hours prior to making a purchase or at least in the form of a sign. Would much rather enjoy a pre-made croissant and better drink options at the adjacent Starbucks or PJs. Lesson learned."

w0lcP2ngFaUpBGi5yzlYDw,Yah Mon,"301 W Platt St, Unit C",Tampa,FL,33606,697,sVMZ9sgBqM7yEgOh2-OUZA,2,"Summary: terrible value, unreasonable wait times, extremely inattentive service staff, and perhaps worst of all, smooth jazz. 

When I read some of the reviews on here, I feel like I must have gone to a different restaurant than everybody else. My experience was not a positive one. Let me first say that my friends are now mad at me for bringing them here. I thought it would be hard to go wrong with a 5-star reviewed restaurant, but I was completely mistaken.

Now, the few positives: the jerk chicken was tasty, and the johnny cakes moreso. The staff was courteous. That''s it.

The staff. We got in at 8, and they came for the drink order at 8:25. We ordered our food at the same time, because we didn''t know when we''d see them again. Twice in the next half hour, they came by twice to confirm our orders. Some mix-up. We noticed this happening at other tables around us as well. (Some of) the food arrived at 9:30. We waited for more than an hour for our meals! And two of our side orders were forgotten. Was the restaurant unusually busy? Only 60% of the tables were occupied. The other problem with the servers is that, like the menu, they didn''t make clear what came with the meals. If somebody is ordering something that already comes with the meal, the staff would think to tell them, right? No. And if you order a beverage, expect it to be about 80% ice. My friends finished theirs in a few sips. So we had to ask for more beverages, and the staff did not bring any. Finally one friend had to go to their car to get some water. A good 20 minutes later I was able to flag them down, and we finally got more to drink. Everyone was cordial, but ignored us for most of the night. The word amateurish comes to mind.

The ambience? Well, the dining room is nicely decorated, but too cramped. The gentleman at the table behind me kept ramming into my chair. There was just no room. It also would have been nice if they weren''t showing The Walking Dead on the big screen TV in front of me. I don''t really want to see stabbings and blood spurting while I''m eating. The biggest problem with the setting, though, was the music. A never-ending procession of smooth jazz played at an uncomfortably high volume. I want to know, who actually enjoys that music? My friend said it felt like being trapped in a dentist''s waiting room.

The food. My friend who ordered beef patties said that they were lousy. And we all agreed that the rice and peas were completely flavorless. It came in a ''bowl'' the size of a tea cup. As I mentioned, the jerk chicken was tasty, but the portion laughably small. The large portion meal at Yah Mon is significantly smaller than the regular portion at Jerk Hut. I understand that it''s organic, but when you order the large portion, you shouldn''t go home hungry. And that''s exactly what I did. 

The only reason I''m not giving 1 star is because some of the minuscule portions of food were tasty.

Obviously, none of us are going back, and I couldn''t recommend Yah Mon to anyone with whom I wanted to stay friends."

We had one unfortunate incident at the restaurant attached to the hotel - 4 of us went to breakfast there this morning. We''re English by birth but we''ve lived in Los Angeles for many years.  However, the restaurant staff heard our English accents and decided that they could take us for a ride with the tip.  When presenting us with the check, they added a 20% tip to the final total.  We immediately addressed it with the manager - firstly, a check should never be presented with gratuity added unless it''s a party of 6 or more.  Secondly, automatically adding 20% is just rude.  Fact of the matter is, we probably would have tipped 20%.  The managers response was weak.  He informed us that many Europeans don''t know the tipping ettiquette and therefore, they decided to assist us by ''adding 20% to the check.  His manner and demeanor was completely offensive."

The spicy tuna is so spicy you won''t taste the tuna at all. Flavorful and heavy, like pub food. We got nigiri as a palette cleanser, I don''t think there was any vinegar in the rice at all (which is what sushi means). It was good, but not what I expected. Like when you invite a couple friends over for a quiet kickback and it turns into a rager. Fun in an overestimating kind of way."

The care given by the doctors,(Dr. Carrier-Kinsley*), N.A.''s is Outstanding! As a single mom, I got a lot of irons in the fire most days, but these guys keep me on track with daily reminders about appointments, need shots etc. I also Love that I can now access my children''s records, doctor''s visits, etc. online.

They are my number one, go-to lighting and event production company. They are always friendly on the phone, quick with their proposals and efficient with any and all correspondence. I have even annoyingly texted their personal phones during out of office hours and received responses to my frantic questions.  They work extremely hard to ensure that all of my events are done well and thoroughly.  If there is ever an issue, they immediately send someone out to correct the problem. The owner, Trevor, has even driven over an hour out to a job-site, to personally ensure that my event was taken care of. I have gotten to know their setup crew well, and they go above and beyond in horrific wet weather, summer heat, muddy and dusty grounds. They even help with things that tent even their job sometimes! They are amazing at what they do and I highly recommend them!"

I''ve had the mango snow smoothie with boba and matcha milk tea with half boba and half pudding at half sweetness. The matcha milk tea was perfect. Strong matcha flavor, just the right level of sweetness, perfectly cooked boba, and good pudding. I was really happy that the barista asked me about sweetness level because I didn''t realize they allowed customization.

The mango, I will probs not get again. Was syrupy and overly sweet (before I knew to ask for reduction in sweetness) and tasted a bit too artificial for me. I will have to  stick to the milk teas. Also wish they added a few more bubbles.

The baristas are exceptionally friendly and always patient with my indecisiveness. Service is quick and drinks are always served with a smile. A smile and good milk tea definitely make my day!"

I walked in here to grab a lunch order recently around 12:30 and it was 80% full of dine-in customers. 

Unfortunately there was a clan of about a dozen senior citizens in front of me that couldn''t make up their minds. 

I walked out, got back into my car and went right to the drive thru. The employee taking my order was clear through the speaker and very polite. I got to the window and realized I forgot an item and she added it on my order, updated my price and took care of it very easily. 

The drive thru process saved me a few minutes, as I''m sure the staff inside was just as efficient as the drive thru staff. 

My food was good and hot when I ate it. The fries didn''t have a ton of salt, which I really prefer. My burger wasn''t very big but was good. 

Inside was a very nice flat screen TV, which I have never seen in any Wendy''s before. They also have the Coke freestyle machine, which is a very nice feature. This Wendy''s is by far one of the nicer locations in all of Tampa. 

My issue with Wendy''s is that they advertise these huge juicy burgers on TV. They look fantastic but when you unwrap them it''s very disappointing as they are extremely small. I get that every restaurant does this during advertising, but Wendy''s really exaggerates their product on TV. 

Wendy''s is like a person on a dating website that displays their best pictures and their best qualities, except it''s nothing like the pictures when you see it in person and is a major disappointment."

Bijna gingen er mensen die later waren gearriveerd dan wij er met onze lang verwachte krukken vandoor, maar de barman regelde dit op sublieme wijze. Het moraal van dit verhaal- je raakt hier niet geïrriteerd omdat andere mensen voor schnitzelen. Ondertussen word je getrakteerd op de lekkerste live muziek en hebben ze er heerlijke cocktails en prima wijnen. Eten was ondergeschikt deze avond, maar wat we hadden was bijzonder goed.

I5KZm-NnxYeEQsmp6nK5_w,Las Cazuelas Restaurant BYOB,426 W Girard Ave,Philadelphia,PA,19123,338,CmdRIsHtLEWTBC3Wk0tRpQ,2,"I tried Las Cazuelas recently, after hearing pretty good things about the food and atmosphere.  The first day I went in the place was crowded but we were seated promptly and our order was taken right away.  The food came out fast for how many people were there.  However, it lacked any real flavor.  Camarone tacos for me and a seitan dish for my friend.  The seitan was way too salty with no other flavour and the tacos were very bland.  Still hungry, we got the ceviche.  This was the ONLY good thing about our meal.  Water glasses weren''t filled at all during the meal, even after the restaurant emptied.

I decided to go back a few days later, to give it another chance.  We had a different server this time, who seemed very new to the business.  Tables who sat after us had their order taken before.  However, again, the food came out fast.  (Wrong order first, but quickly fixed.)  This time I got the veggie enchiladas and my friend got the camarone dish.  Again, VERY disappointed.  Salt and pepper seem to be their only seasonings.  The shrimp had NO flavour, they were very much overcooked.  The sauce on the enchiladas was the same salsa put out on the tables as you are seated.  The veggies on the side of the shrimp meal were the exact same as the ones in the enchiladas.  There is no creativity or thought behind any of these meals.

I will not be going back.  I have had MUCH better Mexican off of the trucks in South Philly."

My wife picked up a rock in Tucson a few weeks back and it made about a 20 crack from the edge of the front windshield to the middle on the driver''s side. Being a frugal person, I was hoping to get it repaired...but, after doing some Internet research it became obvious this was not going to be possible or cost effective. I read reviews of places around the area and contacted about 4 of them. Tony''s had the fastest response and was the most honest in answering my questions. I dealt with Hector and I was impressed. No BS...he answered all my questions in a straight-forward honest manner. I was under the mistaken impression that there was an Antenna in the front windshield which Hector correctly told me there wasn''t. After educating myself on issues with Windshields, I asked Hector who was the manufacturer of the glass they used. He told me who they used, why they used them, and why they were top quality. Other companies in town did not respond to this question...seriously, the top rated guy on Yelp, quit answering my emails when I asked him who manufactured the glass he used...REALLY? Now, the kicker is Tony''s price was the lowest of all 4 I contacted. And, not just a few dollars...he charged $125 including taxes...I had no idea you could get a front windshield replaced for that. The others were anywhere from $37 to $100+ more. Hector, keep up the good work...I will refer anyone I know to your place for any glass work."

Ordered the double mushroom and got more mushrooms than burger patty. Almost reminds me of a McDonald''s burger patty. Even with 2 patties the burger felt mediocre at best.

Also had the beausoleil oyster with chopped cucumber and some kind of mignette- delightful and you can buy them individually so you don''t have to get a full order like many places!

The rose sour cocktail was right up my alley- slightly sweet and made with bubbles- how could I not like it?

We also ordered the sorghum bacon- thick cut like pork belly- sweet sauce! Yummy!

However, they lose 4 of those stars for shabby work. My rims looked absolutely horrible! Apparently, the car washing gauntlet does not reach the wheels/rims. Additionally, they completely failed to wipe any of the brake dust from any of the 4 rims. I called one of the attendants to re-do the rims but the 2nd go round wasn''t much more remarkable.

We shared a 12 thin crust with bacon and ricotta and it may have been one of the best pizzas we both have had. 

Only weird thing was the fact that their was absolutely no lighting in the bathroom. This only mattered a wee bit because my friend and I tried to reaply a little bit of make up before heading to the concert. But it worked out and we were fine.

It is really convenient that you can sit at the counter and get waited on there.

Service:  The staff was upbeat and pleasant.  They were the ones who recommended we sit at the counter, which was a really nice experience.  We didn''t feel rushed to get out of our seats.  It was really great that they offer you a sample of the food if you are unsure.

Food:  Overall very good.  I was hoping for a bit more spice and strong flavors, but it seems like it is made marketable for the general population.  Which worked out fine with me because there were seasonings available on the counter to bump up the flavor profile.  I got the etouffee and bread pudding.  The etouffee was good, but the flavor got a little muddled after eating it for a while.  It didn''t have the depth of flavor that I was hoping for.  The bread pudding was super delicious!  I would recommend it to anyone needing a sweet fix.  My friend enjoyed her jambalaya.

Overall:  I would certainly come back.  The convenient location, good service, and yummy food are all definite pluses.  I am not sure that it is the best New Orleans place in Philly, but I am happy to partake of the menu again sometime soon."

The host, of course, were more than happy to accommodate me. They mentioned their Sweet Potato Agnolotti so I accepted. It was amazing. I also enjoyed their house Cabernet a lot.

rTW2Og0Tg-OkLTvRwgYO9Q,Courtyard by Marriott Nashville Downtown,170 4th Ave N,Nashville,TN,37219,110,DYA4s9eupIS2SEveRLMBTg,1,"Do not stay here!  

We had a very bad experience with this hotel.  Let me start by saying that we reserved a room for our wedding night.  The next morning we had a very early flight to Montego Bay so we checked out of our room around 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  We actually had no complaints until we tried to use our debit card on a large purchase in Jamaica on our honeymoon and it was denied.  OK, this special time that only happens once in your life.... was completely ruined because this hotel charged our account 3 TIMES for the room amount at a whopping $240 a pop. We only left a small amount in our checking account because we were travelling out of country (just in case something happened and someone got our card number or something).  After getting charged $19.99 per MB to check our bank account using data on my cell phone, we discovered this MESS that Courtyard put us in.  

We had planned on a couple''s massage by the beach in Jamaica but that couldn''t happen!  Plans on our honeymoon were ruined and I am still very upset!!!

After getting back into the states on a Saturday evening, I called the hotel to try and figure out what as going on.  I was told that a manager would have to speak with me and she would not be in until Tuesday.  I was forwarded to her voicemail and left a message.  The manager finally got back with me and she stated that she had no idea what was going on.  I explained to her my process through booking: I am a Marriott Rewards Member so I just logged into my account and booked a room.  After realizing that I would not be about to check into the room at check in since our wedding was at 4pm I called the hotel and added my husband to the account so that he could check into the room.  I also asked about how much the deposit for the room would be since Marriott usually charges a deposit in case of any charges.  The lady told me that it varies per hotel and I told her that I needed to know (since we were only transferring a certain amount into our checking).  She called the hotel and then finally got back on the line with me... she said that the deposit would not be more than $50.  When he went to check in he told them he wasn''t sure what name the reservation was under it could have been either one of our last names. They found the reservation and got him checked in.  We checked out at 5:30 a.m. the next morning and that was all we knew.  The manager had then figured out what had happened: They created a new reservation for my husband and then charged me for a NO SHOW on my reservation.  The third charge was the pre-authorization that showed $220!  Let me re-cap:  They charged me 2 TIMES FOR THE ROOM and screwed up the check in.  THEN... they neglected to let us know that the pre-authorization and the room cost would be charged in the same amount on the same day of check in!  They also charged us for parking!  We had already parked our car in a parking garage and did not park with them!   The manager acted as if it was my husbands fault for creating a new reservation.   I assured her that he absolutely knew that we had a reservation and wouldn''t have created a new reservation that it must have been her staff that messed up!  

She credited my account for the no-show, told me that the pre-authorization takes 7 business days to fall off of the account, and then credited me for the parking.  She did credit back all fraudulent charges to our account!  However, she can never replace what we lost on our honeymoon all because of their screw ups and neglect in informing us about the pre-authorization and room charge on the same day!  (Basically it showed up twice in one day right after another... which makes no sense... usually a pre-authorization is charged to hold the money and then the balance is updated... like when you leave a tip at a restaurant... not two separate charges!).

Ridiculous!!"
VrGxoSNZfSiT-G4OqRRGIw,Sunset 44 Bistro,118 W Adams Ave,Saint Louis,MO,63122,73,5__JjkQWxf66XLkWvxdr5g,3,"My husband and I dined here for the first time last night to celebrate his birthday. Here''s the breakdown!
Atmosphere-
This restaurant seems to be disjointed. I really liked the ambiance and feel in the bar area and a small seating area connecting to the main dining area. For some reason, I wasn''t feeling it in the main dining area (where we sat). I guess that''s the idea and maybe we should have asked to sit in a different area. Part of it may have to do with the fact that we were the youngest people in the place by about 40 years. We could hear the commotion in the kitchen, which was weird because it didn''t seem like we were that close to it. Next time I would request to be seated elsewhere.
Service-
Our waitress was alright, she just seemed a little out of place. She broke a dish on the floor, and overall was a bit sloppy. She was nice enough though, and checked on us an adequate amount. 
Food- 
I loved the fact that there was the option to order petite serving, which upon arrival to our table seemed laughable. But once I started eating, it was the perfect amount of food! I ordered the Cedar Plank Salmon and my husband ordered the Crab Cakes. My salmon was delicious and crab cakes decent. However, our sides were just OK. Also my husband''s salad seemed straight out of a bag. We were pleasantly surprised at the end of the meal when our server brought us 2 mini chocolate fudge cookies. Mmmmm! The perfect end to the meal!

I might try this place again for drinks/appetizers or I could see a mother''s day brunch here, but overall our dining experience wasn''t that memorable. Maybe we will give it another try, because I really want to like this place!"

I saw Baklava, and was told not to purchase them by the sales associate (and I appreciate her honesty) because they were hard as a rock..  I then purchased to cakes, a Pound cake, and a peanut butter mousse cake.  Everyone was looking forward to the peanut butter cake.  EVERYONE TOOK A BITE AND SPIT IT OUT!  IT WAS STALE.  The chocolate was ok, but the mousse has a horrible RANK taste, and SMELL as well.  It tasted and smelled  like spoiled cream cheese.  It wasn''t one of those things that taste like something, IT WAS SPOILED.  Even the partial peanut butter cups on the top tasted stale!!!

The pound cake was ok, nothing special..  Needless to say, the experience of tasting spoiled food makes me never to return again!"

idu9-lsH5FJ54xt9QdNezQ,Il Giardino,907 N Bethleham Pike,Spring House,PA,19477,92,556ozG8Mac7Gg4zeqBybcA,4,"What a fantabulous date night with my favorite hometown chica at Il Giardino :-)  I was stoked about trying out this Italian restaurant for a while now because I had not yet been completely satisfied with my meal at any of the other Italian restaurants (chain or not) I''ve been to...and Il Giardino seemed like the hidden gem of Springhouse as it is tucked away in one of many shopping centers on that side of Bethlehem Pike.

Like Bacco, Il Giardino specializes in pizza (actually, I have yet to try Bacco''s pizza, so stay tuned!), so it was time for the ultimate test:  how does its white pizza play out?  Was I setting myself up for utter disappointment, or was I going to be enlightened?  White pizza is not exactly the most complicated-looking pizza around, but I only know of one other place that makes a few versions of it spectacularly (Top Tomato in Philly!!!).  

As serendipity would have it,  I received two pizzas on this date night: one which I had ordered (prochuitto gourmet pizza) and the other that was free (Il Giardino white gourmet pizza) because the free one was apparently sent to my table by accident -- yay!!!  It was a wonderful surprise, because the pizza was fantastic.  The white pizza that eventually came out for me was also very delicious and is definitely in my top 3.  

The atmosphere, I must add, feels intimate not just because it was small (I would say that it''s 1/10 the size of The Olive Garden) but because on this Thursday date night, there were people who were enjoying themselves around their respective dinner tables like families, even if they really weren''t in the same family."

We called early in the day for a reservation at 5:30 but when we arrived they couldn''t locate it. No problem. The place was not crowded when we arrived and we were promptly seated. When we left the place was full. I would suggest making reservations as I imagine on the weekend it is packed.

Our waiter was very professional and helpful with recommendations. Our first wine selection couldn''t be located but the recommended substitute was excellent.

The fresh, warm bread we started out with was very good. We shared the toasted raviolis and the mushrooms with polenta. Both were excellent. I would say these are some of the best toasted raviolis around.  It''s very easy to tell they were never frozen. I ordered the Hay and Straw and loved it. I even had leftovers which is a rare event. The other two dining partners loved their meals as well.

I will come back here again when looking for a great Italian meal in a classy setting."

We were seated right away and had a perfectly attentive waitress. Service was awesome for a working lunch. We never went without but there weren''t a ton of interruptions.

I got one of their specials, the bacon turkey burger and fries. The burger was good sized for a lunch portion. After eating it, I was full but not stuffed. The burger itself was well seasoned. The turkey was light but hearty enough. The bacon was mostly good but part of it was not as crispy as I like it. It comes with all the fixings. I got fries as my side. They were perfectly cooked. Very crispy outside but not burnt. They were salty with a lot of flavor. I just wish there was a little more of them. 

It was a great lunch all around."

It''s beautiful and really nice to just walk around and take it all in. My brother and sister have stayed here for an event, and they really enjoyed it, except for the high price tag. The convention center area itself is huge, with gorgeous carpeting, interior decor, etc. all around. There are frequently events and meetings at the convention center, so it''s always pretty busy. However, what I really love is the garden area in the center of Opryland. As many of the other reviewers have pointed out, the entire area is enclosed, but it really feels like you are outside walking around in an outdoor garden that is always kept at a nice breezy 75 degrees or so. This in itself just amazes me. There are winding paths (nothing super strenuous), waterfalls, and beautiful greenery and flowers everywhere. There are quite a few shops and restaurants all around the hotel, but the pricing is pretty expensive (I will give a shoutout to Stax though -- a delicious make-your-own burger place). Tip: Park in the back near the Opry Mills Mall and take a short (5 min) walk to a side/back entrance of Opryland. You will save $20+ from not parking in the front."

And I''ve had them picked same-day from the Monterey Bay. It surprised me to learn that the oysters are harvested from New Orleans, I had no idea that N.O. had access to such top notch shellfish. Anyways happy hour features deals on signature cocktails, 75 cent oysters and cheap apps, I went there twice during my week in N.O. and I should have gone more. 

Other than the amazing briny ice cold oysters, my wife and I also had a selection of various apps and cocktails all of which were in the good to excellent range. The one that really sticks out is the squash blossoms - do not miss this one even if trying new food scares you. They have a texture and flavor similar to a delicate bell pepper, and they are perfectly tempura battered and stuffed with tangy goat cheese with a little honey drizzle. It made me go home and plant a squash just so I can harvest the blossoms and recreate this dish. Luke hits a nice balance between casual and formal, from the atmosphere to the menu to the prices.

On the bright side because they are so busy the wait isn't too long after you order. Its better to get this to go and eat in your car unless you have a table already since seating can be hard to come by.

I lived in Tampa a long time and got to eat a lot of Cuban food. I''m excited to have another Cuban place here in Indy. There aren''t many. 

When I think of good Cuban food, I think of Cuban bread, yucca, plantains, pork and cafe con leche...just to name a few.

Today, we got the Cuban sandwich and the plantains. They were both really good. The portion size of the sandwich was huge. It could easily be shared. The pork and ham were good.

There were two big misses. The biggest miss is the bread. It''s just not right. It was almost the consistency of a cracker. It wasn''t bad, but ALL of the Cuban bread I''ve ever eaten was much better. Even if it''s pressed, I''ve never had cracker-like Cuban bread.

Cuban bread is something that I would order as a side, I love it so much. This bread missed the mark.

Maybe I missed it, but there was no yucca on the menu. I really love good Cuban yucca. That was the other miss."

I had the Fenway, that has sausage and pepper''s. Also had the sweet potato tots, a local beer on tap  and the Kentucky Thunder shake. All was awesome in taste and flavor. Also no complaints from the other 9 in the group. Definitely would go back."
HVtsnFYAHqqPhJ1-rlWPFQ,Hahka Kitchens,72 Santa Felicia Dr,Goleta,CA,93117,6,XHXbEaiMsdFIQBgZK4MjxQ,5,I had Hahka Kitchens do my kitchen remodel and could not be happier.  The process was so smooth from the moment I walked in just to get a rough estimate to the finish. They couldn't be nicer people to work with.  Linda is a great designer and Randy is an excellent contractor.  We came up with several solutions to things that I didn't care for.  I love the cabinets I choose with the door style and finish.  The hardest selection to make was the Cambria quartz countertop and they were very patient in ordering larger samples of a number of options.  My kitchen remodel turned into a kitchen remodel with new flooring and a few changes in the bathroom and Randy was happy to answer all of my questions. The Ocampo brothers did excellent work installing the cabinets and hardware.  They were so pleasant to have working in my home and were very careful when installing my appliances.

All the food is the same in Wawa to me, but it is a pretty big store compared to other ones around the area I''ve been to. The only thing I don''t like is that sometimes their ATMs do not work."

I paid and she put my money on the counter and moved her head to look behind me to ask the lady she is ready. So I sat and watched her take the next lady and her money. Well she thanked her for business and gave her money in her hand bottom line. So now I can say it's a racist business!!!!! I watched them greet everyone and thank them for their business. BUT ME. They won't get another dollar from me or anyone I know.

Her sense of humor kept us entertained and feeling welcome.  We couldn''t asked for a better and more upbeat personality.  She definitely deserves positive accolades from all who work with her.

We were seated in the back room which was nice and had the best server.  The back room is much quieter and made for a great place to enjoy our food and chat with our friends.  Our table ordered 48 oysters to start and the order came out in decent time.  I really enjoyed the oyster feast.

The food and drinks were all pretty good but the one thing that would make me not come back to this restaurant are the overly high chairs and tables. My entire party had to literally climb up into the chairs and then you feel like you are jumping down when you had to get out of the chair. At one point one person in our party went to the restroom and came back and stood the rest of the time because they said it was too hard to get back into the high chair. These were handmade and the person who made them neglected to use proper height measurements for high top tables and chairs. They are a safety hazzard.

Decor is awesome. Very open and great natural lighting. We checked out upstairs before we left and it was great also. They did an awesome job decorating and I was really impressed how well this place was put together!!! So cool to see this old building turned into something so awesome! 

Went for with our family and friends, table of 7. We were seated quickly, service was prompt. Orders were correct. We had 3 burgers, pulled pork, Mac n cheese and the kale and cheese dip between all of us and not one of us was disappointed. Great food. Fries were crispy but not overdone and burgers were delicious. Cooked perfectly and nice and juicy. 

Beers. Great. Tasty. My wife had a taster and all were really good. Neither of us are stout fans but it will still good and we both loved the IPA. 

We all agreed that we can''t wait to come down for drinks and dinner with no kiddos so we can try the whiskey!"

I tried about 5 other places before stumbled upon this one 3 months ago.  Wanted to try several times before writing a review since consistency is important. Their broth is awesome. Enough flavors to keep digging in, tender meats, fresh munk beans, basil and not so quick yet efficient service. I also tried their charbroiled pork (#44) and it''s really good. Just right. I wish the place is a tad cleaner, hence 4 stars, rather than 5. Overalls, it is a great place if you''re in the mood for pho."

I queried closing time as thought maybe times wrong online but he said no it''s 11pm! 
I just found it uncomfortable sitting and eating whilst they clean and pack up although have 2 hours work remaining!?! 
Saying all that the ice cream was really good and a great range of flavours. The ice cream was tasty and generous servings were good although at nearly $5 for 2 scoops it''s a little bit expensive."

MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,Han Dynasty,3711 Market St,Philadelphia,PA,19104,783,sCXH6IWTNha4fpxrTkO9Wg,5,"Han Dynasty is one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.  I first found the Manayunk location, and my wife and I ate there several times.  We heard about it from a friend who turned us on to the spicy cucumbers, which are just wonderful.

Eventually I tried the University City location, and it''s much more hip.  I really don''t care about ambiance, but if you are seeking a more polished/trendy type of place, go to University City over Manayunk.  The food in both places is just incredible.

Han Dynasty serves food in very large, family sized portions.  It''s most fun when you are with a bit of a group, so you can order a number of different things, and try them all.

On their specials menu, they have Spicy Aroma Fish which is just absolutely beyond this world.  SO good.  Another major hit was the dry pot style.  My wife and I are big seafood fans, so we get shrimp as the protein, but you have complete flexibility to pick whichever protein suits your taste.

They have numbers on the menu, 1-10, beside each dish.  This is the relative spiciness rating.  It''s really hard to describe the type of heat in these Szechuan dishes... it isn''t the kind of heat that just burns your mouth.  The heat is very strong, but it''s all flavor.  

Dry pepper style is another type of preparation that we have tried and loved.

Several reviews mention the Dan Dan noodles... they are wonderful, but they are indeed rather oily.  It''s just the nature of this cuisine.  I think the food is wonderfully prepared, one just has to know that chili oil and sesame oil will make the food a bit on the oily side.  

Absolute top notch rating for this place.  Love it!"

I reserved our room on line, and only found out about these fees when looking at the reviews on yelp when trying to find if any of the restaurants in the resort were worth trying. I called and spoke to a manager on duty about these fees and she refused to refund the fees since I checked the terms and conditions box on the reservations page. I informed the MOD that I had neglected to read all of the terms and conditions, therefore she refused to help. After returning home I looked at the terms and conditions on the reservations page, where the check box appears and indeed it does tell of the $15 resort fee, but fails to mention the $18 parking fee. 

This room was $250 per night before taxes. The room was nothing special. I''ve stayed in La Quinta Inns and other places that were just as nice, if not better, for far less. 

I also was left wondering what happened to the southern hospitality that us southerners are supposed to be so well known for.

When I pay $250 a night for a room, I don''t expect to be charged exorbitant fees for things I get for free at far less expensive hotels."

After multiple parties complained, asked to be moved, or left altogether, what did the management do? NOTHING! Just kept serving them more beer.

It''s hard to justify $25-$30 dishes when the atmosphere is that of no-class dive bar. And skip the octopus. It''s overcooked and rubbery.

I called to make an appointment, and Sue did my nails. She rushed throughout my appointment, she was rough on my nails while filing them, and the whole process was incredibly uncomfortable. Each nail ended up a different length, even after I asked her to even them out, and then she began the polish. I ended up with red nail polish all over the edges of my skin and she couldn''t be bothered to clean it up. She passed me onto someone else after my nails were done curing and I got the most pathetic little hand massage ever and was sent on my way. The whole process took about 20 minutes, but here I am on day 4 after getting my nails done, and most of them have chipped with two lifting completely. 

I called today to see if I could come in to have them repair my nails and was told they would have to decide if they''d fix it or not. My gel manicures normally last between 2-3 weeks easily, so 4 days is completely unacceptable.

zwTmOj4B_OVPMTMYijQiKg,Queen Sheba,4511 Baltimore Ave,Philadelphia,PA,19143,64,pbXbIoZwe6cEihaYqbkSHw,3,"It was a pretty cute little restaurant; the atmosphere was definitely neighborhood pub.  We had a very nice (very obviously not Ethiopian) waitress with multiple visible piercings.  She was (*gasp* ) very attentive for an Ethiopian restaurant waitress.  The service was not as good quick as the average non-Ethiopian restaurant, but it definitely blew all the Ethiopian restaurant services away with the speed!  Gee, I wonder if it could be because she''s not Ethiopian?!?!?!  hahaha  However, she did mention that she grew up in West Philly eating Ethiopian food.  mmmm I''m jealous!  

As is my custom, I went to use the bathroom and wash my hands before the meal.  Considering that Ethiopian food is eaten with one''s hands, I would highly recommend this practice to all my friends .  There were two stalls in the bathroom.  Both stalls have saloon styled doors (2 halves swinging freely in the middled, hinged on either side).  The first one was lit, but the right half of the door was missing.  Given this, I opted for the second stall.  After stepping inside, I noticed a good 2 inches between the halves of the door.  Needless to say, I did my business in a hurry all the while praying that no one else would come in.  PLEASE LADIES, GO TO THE BATHROOM BEFORE EATING AT THIS RESTAURANT.  It is a harrowing experience!

When the food came (sooner than expected), the portions were fairly generous.  When I bit into the injera at the Queen of Sheba, I was pleasantly surprised.  It was fairly sour!  It was not as sour as Abyssinia''s injera, but definitely a few steps more sour than anywhere else I have tried up to date.  Now, I''m not saying ideal injera should be sour, but I like mine that way.   hahaha  Unfortunately parts of the injera were a little dried.  *sigh*   It''s a toss up for me between dried injera versus more sour injera.   

The dishes were all decent, but not amazing.  My companion liked the potatoes in the carrot, string bean, potato dish.  I thought their salad was fabulous - fresh and dressed perfectly.  I did not care for the raw onions, but have to admit the taste was a nice contrast to the other dishes.  Both lentil dishes were decent, as I have said before it is difficult for me to tell much of a difference in them.  However, my trusty sidekick noted that the lentils were more watery at Kaffa Crossing.  I know that 1 of the lentil dishes was too spicy for me, but I am a big, Big wuss when it comes to spices, so that is neither here nor there.

Waited maybe 45 mins for a table in the ramen room- no big deal, we just had drinks at the bar, which were good. I''d recommend he drink that has activated charcoal in it -- it was so good. 

Our waitress was really really nice but that''s where the good things I have to say end. Most of us ordered ramen and all of the noodles were super starchy, like how they are when over-cooked. It really was not enjoyable. I didn''t complain because I don''t really do that, but some of my friends did and were told that''s how he noodles were supposed to taste. When two in my group tried to order something else, the waitress (who was so sweet) had to come back and tell one of them that the chef didn''t want to make what she ordered (an item that was on the menu) because he was pushing a different combination of fish. That was ridiculous. 

Overall my impression was that the wait staff is great, but whoever the chef is gets a 0 star review from me. 

I''ve heard the Tampa location is way better, so I''d just go there."

I had the coconut milk, fried calamari, and baked Philly roll. Lots of food at a good price and I left feeling stuffed.

The pictures of the burger look so amazing how can you not want to just eat your phone BUT the BBQ oysters at Red Fish Grill I know are amazing BUT the BBQ shrimp cooked in spices and herb butter at Deanies are so highly regarded.  SO where would you eat if it was your last lunch of a great NO trip?  Hard to choose, right?  Wrong!!  We went to all three and were not disappointed in the least.  I suggest you do the same.  
Start at Lukes and split the $16 dollar burger kinda pricey but very tasty.  Then Walk over to Red Fish Grill and eat  two orders of their BBQ Oysters (you''ll feel cheated if you get just one order) with an Ice cold beer. Now realistically that should be enough for lunch but its only fish, not too filling? 
Now onto Deanies to sit at the bar and eat these amazing shrimp, however, I''m not sure what was better the shrimp or the loaf of French bread to dip into the butter with and washed down with an ice cold Heferweisen on tap!!! My God was it satisfying. I haven''t felt that satisfied since my first time!!! Screw the calories I''m in Nawleans! Now I think I know what a junkie must go thru when he needs his fix.  You can''t just get these flavors anywhere you know. 
And if all of the above wasn''t enough like too idiots we walked to Café du Mond for coffee and beignets. 
We took a cab back to the hotel because we obviously could not walk, had a quickie and took a nap so we could dine at GW FINS which was also a fantastic experience.  Try the Scallabutt (scallops fused with a hunk of Halibut).  Se bon!! and Happy eating!"

It''s not close to me but I made the trip because it is supposedly great!  Sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door.

One of them approached but didn''t say anything, she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table.  She didn''t ask for drink orders or anything, just brought us some waters without saying a word.  

We selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return.  And waited some more.  And some more.  Finally after about 10 minutes I got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet, again without saying a word.  The miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn''t great.  When the sushi arrived, I noticed it was only about half of our order.  I wasn''t too worried about it though, because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it''s not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time.

My Etouffee was great, my date''s steak was over cooked and possibly expedited wrong, as it took mere seconds for them to return with a medium rare steak.

I really wanted the bread pudding with pecan sauce just didn''t have room, so ordered it via room service the next night and again was under whelmed again, it arrived only slightly warm with the ice cream completely melted (they were in separate containers). 

On our last day in town (Friday) we wanted to give it one more shot since it wasn''t Mardi Gras and life seemed to be returning to normal... court-bouillon was okay, however the chicken on my salade de poulet grille, was almost raw, that''s right, barely cooked chicken on my plate!

Indoor swimming pools usually give me a bad headache, but the intense headache and nausea I feel here has so far been unrivaled. 84 degrees year round? Let''s try closer to 98 degrees. Once you add in all those hyperactive kids with their insanely high metabolisms packed into the small space, the heat problem gets really out of control. They do offer alcohol for the adult crowd, but I don''t see how anyone could get through a drink without upchucking.

Even in the winter this place is always crowded. I wouldn''t really suggest going in winter, and not just because swimming doesn''t sound appealing in the winter. When the outdoor section is closed off, indoors it''s slim pickings for attractions. This really is quite a small water park. As far as cleanliness is concerned, it certainly could be worse. However, I feel like the water is always a bit dingy here. You will need a shower ASAP after leaving.

If you''re really hard up for entertainment, then you could always come here with small kids and they''ll have a blast. That being said, there''s far better water parks out there to choose from."

If you''re looking for high-end anything I would be really surprised if Fair Wheel didn''t have it in stock (or if they didn''t have it in stock, they could get it for you relatively quickly). The staff are extremely helpful and attentive. And if you''re active in the local scene you could easily waste an hour in the shop just talking about bikes and bike racing. A true gem in Tucson."

Our servers were friendly, sweet and on their A-game. The very small kitchen has a little trouble keeping up with the demand of the closely-packed tables. Highest praise for the fried green tomatoes and the avocado bowl. The Caesar salad had freshly grilled chicken and thick shavings of parmesan. The oyster po boy was full of outstanding oysters and served on really good bread. There were a couple of disappointments: the coffee tasted as if it had been stewing too long and the pancakes weren''t warm when they hit the table, but they were still tasty. Will definitely return."

We came here to end our family vacation, knowing it was going to be pricey. I''d urge everyone to look into the costs up front, so you don''t have any surprises on check out. We checked in on a Sunday afternoon, and it was really quick. The rep was knowledgeable and friendly and gave instructions on how to find our room. The room was the cheapest they had, but still really nice, and very clean. We dropped our stuff off and explored. There is so much to see and so much to do. Some of the activies are free, like the fountain show in the evenings, but most aren''t, such as the riverboat ride or the spa services. 
Dinner our first night was at the Cantina. Prices are decent, and the service was good. Our second night we ate at Piaso (pizza). The pizza was good, for the price. Generous servings for $4. Friendly service and a decent selection of wines. There are at least three coffee houses that I counted, and all serve Starbucks coffee. 
There are three pools - one indoor and two outdoor. The Cascades Outdoor Pool has already 1.5'' small pool that was perfect for our three year old, and the larger pool went up to 4''6 which was great for our 8 year old. There is a great locker room by the Cascades Indoor Pool that has showers, a hair dryer, and restrooms. 
Overall my family and I had a great time, and I don''t regret the money we spent for the two nights we were here (which was a lot). Just do your research, and take the time to see the scenery. It is breathtaking!"

Usually when I order a 7-9 dollar cheesesteak I save half for another time so I don''t feel like I''m over-eating. When my chicken cheesesteak was put in front of me today I had to ask the waiter if the cook accidentally used only half the normal portion of meat. I''ve never seen such an empty steak sandwich in my life and easily housed the whole thing, plus the measly pickle spear and miniature bag of chips. 

After confronting the waiter he asked me if I wanted another and I told him no, not if this is the normal portion size. Do they always look so empty? I won''t quote the waiter exactly but his reply was along the lines of that''s the normal portion size but the chef doesn''t know what he''s doing and that''s why it looks small. 

This was a disgrace of a cheesesteak, and thus worthy of a 2 star review considering all the times I''ve eaten here in the past have been a solid Meh."

My mother, a regular customer, stopped by shortly before lunch time along with my 1 year old child.  She selected a table in the corner because she didn''t want to inconvenience customers that may enter, since she had a stroller.  The waiter approached and didn''t even even greet her.  

Absolutely no other customers were in the restaurant yet she still had to flag down the waiter to order.  

8 minutes after her soup was served, and midway through eating her meal, the waiter just plopped the check on the table without her asking for it (very classy).  My mother took the bad service in stride and even left a %15 tip.  

As she left with my kid in hand, another waiter ran after her and flagged her down in the parking lot...apparently the owner stated the $10 bill she left was too old and wrinkly...not torn, or damaged, just wrinkly.

My mother didn''t want to create a scene, so she took her wrinkly money back, paid with a credit card with no tip, ha!  

Anyways, food is okay, but it''s certainly a shame both service and ownership are such wrinkle-free-money nazis.  

My tip: bring new sequential dollars bills fresh from the bank if you want to eat here.

Needless to say my family and friends will all keep our distance, since our money is literally no good there."

Truth in dining leads me to report a less than favorable experience after a string of very good ones.  This morning I arrived at 5:30 am as usual and to be honest it was not the same staff that I had seen for the previous two weeks.

We said something to them and they put it back. About 2 minutes later they took it again and walked away.  The adult with them started cursing at us for telling them not to steal.  The management did nothing except tell us to stop arguing.  Disappointing to say the least since the concessions cost a fortune and my own kids got to witness people stealing and getting away with it while their parents tell them no candy, it''s too expensive."

The first time I showed up I was told they were closed for a Spring Spruce up and would be open on the 11th. I left a little annoyed because there was no indication of this on their website, which I had used to look them up and browse the menu. I later discovered they had something up on their Facebook page about being closed, but seeing as those I don''t have a Facebook, this was of no benefit to me. Today (March 15th) I drove all the way over only to discover a sign on the door stating they will be closed the remainder of the week! This time I checked their Facebook and there was no information regarding the extended closure. In fact it was a bit confusing because they had posts advertising the re-opening and even pictures posted of people eating there for a brunch event just the other day. Is this some kind of secret society of delicious eatery? I really wish I knew. Poor communication on the businesses side of things has made me feel like I probably won''t be giving these guys a try. If I do muster up the fortitude to drive clear across town again I will definitely be calling ahead to make sure they are open. I suggest you do the same."

I went to fresh healthy cafe for a mid morning smoothly with my wife. There was no one in the restaurant when we got there. I ordered a smoothy and my wife ordered a latte and a parfait. The parfaits are premade and quite good. The latte came out just as she was finishing her parfait (5 minutes ish), I continued to wait at least a couple of more minutes for my smoothy. I could have made it faster at home. When I did get it, it was not worth the wait. There was far too much ice... They give you a wide slurpy straw to make up for the increased ice volume, it''s just not the consistency I like and had very little flavour because if the high ice volume.

It''s nice to see a healthy option place in my new neighbourhood, but I hope that they vastly improve their service and quality."

I told her that the towels were too hot and she than removed them and swung them in the air to cool off than reapplied. She than asked ''is this better princess .  Than she turned around and ask if that woke me up. I''ve had a gel polish color change several times before, no one has ever placed hot towels on my hands EVER,  i don''t know why she did.

They never do work or buy parts without calling you to get consent; unlike other auto shops that will do work unauthorized and expect you to pay to fix the pixie-dust unicorn O2 sensor* that wasn''t broken in the first place or that you didn''t want to get fixed at the moment.


*pixie dust O2 sensor is purely a hyperbole but you get my point."

I did change though as the last two times I was there the operator who I had an appointment with was not the person who colored my hair. I hate it when I have an appointment with an operator and you wind up getting your hair colored by a junior. 
If your operator is too busy to work with you that means the salon over booked.
 Since this happened two visits in a row I can only assume Fiber does this as a rule.
I am now going to Onde in Newtown Square."

However... if you sit at the bar there is a serious bleach smell that is overwhelming from the glass dishwasher.

The spring rolls here are smaller, there is definitely a lot less meat in the vermecilli noodles dishes, and the seasoning was not as tasty in my opinion.
I''m glad I also tried something different, the sweet and sour fish, it was pretty good but I think after a while the taste would be pretty strong.  I did really like the veggies in the dish though.
I couldn''t stop thinking about the other place. The flavor, the sizes for the price, and the service at the other place was much better than my experience at Pho An Hoa."

Seeing the Trinidadian flag hanging out the door, I knew I had to take my mother there! The ambience was calm and relaxing and our server Jay was very kind. We started with the fried shrimp wantons which were great, and our three dishes: curry goat, curry shrimp and curry chicken roti were all flavorful. The roti was so soft! A mild taste for all backgrounds, but they were happy to bring out a side of pepper sauce for my dad who needed a kick. The owner Anthony was kind enough to greet us and explain the meaning behind the name of the restaurant. The peanut punch is a must have. The food was authentic and satisfied my Trinidadian mother!

They were suppose to be spicy, but I was told they didn''t make them spicy that particular day. Well, okay then. I ordered them anyways and I was so glad that I wasn''t deterred by the fact that they weren''t spicy because they were the most lightly battered, perfectly crunchy, and delicious green beans I have ever tasted. To top it off, the beautiful Santa Barbara County day made the outdoor ambiance the most perfect date for my husband and I."
-If0ps0QhOLCYVWQWs9RYg,Maple Street Patisserie,7638 Maple St,New Orleans,LA,70118,171,6yqgkxJUO4_TSRC5Sjlviw,3,"If you want anything fresh, you gotta come here early, or else you''re going to find yourself waiting for the pastries to bake or just have none at all.

I''m very bad with the names of pastries, but I can say that I definitely like the Guava turnover, bearclaw, almond croissant, and ham and cheese croissant.  I wish they had more savoury pastries, actually I wish they had more stuff in general and maybe sometimes change it up a bit. 

I had in the past gotten used to a routine of getting up in the morning, grabbing a coffee and a pastry to eat before work. Later on in the day I would grab a loaf of bread that I would bring home to eat with dinner or as a snack for breakfast. I wish the bakery was open later, but unfortunately, none of the bakeries in New Orleans are open late, and by late, I mean past 1 or 2 pm. 

That being said, the pastries and sweets are very good when they are fresh and I would give this place more stars if it wasn''t for unpleasant experiences with some of the workers. I have been frequenting Maple Street Patisserie for over a year now and on several occasions I have been treated very rudely by the workers who are frequently impatient, even when there''s no one else in the store, or they act angry as they take the pastry out of the window and shove it onto the plate.  At other times, the workers are actually pretty nice.  So please, if you''re having a bad day, don''t take it out on the customers.

If you want coffee, I would go across the street to Starbucks or down the road to PJ''s, but if you don''t mind average coffee then you can stick to the bakery."

Thankfully they have their own parking lot but there''s plenty of street parking too, which is good because it was packed. The inside was nice and cozy and it had plenty of seating, not that it mattered because it was so crowded but I can''t fault them for that.

The customer service was really good, although the guy who took our order didn''t seem to believe that I knew what a double shot macchiato would be because he kept asking me if I had ever had one before. I badly needed pure caffeine so it was just what I wanted, I''m just not sure what the questioning about my choice was all about.

That being said, when I got it it was great, obviously good quality espresso. My husband got their popular hot chocolate which he wasn''t a fan of but I really liked since it tasted like actual chocolate instead of like a powder. He also got an espresso bar which was some kind of sugary chocolate treat, and he loved that. Their to go cups are also really cute. It''s out of the way but we''ll definitely be back."

First I got in contact with Chelsea Kaplan, the events coordinator, who was so helpful and responsive throughout the planning process.  She always answered my emails right away and made sure that everything was perfect on the day of.  We had the front room for 30 people, and it was a perfect amount of space.  We were all close and cozy without being overcrowded.  It really was such a lovely day!

I chose to have fresh fruit and Danish, orange juice carafes for the champagne I brought for mimosas, and a choice of three entrees for the guests.  Everyone was very happy with the food, which came out really quickly after ordering.  Our main server was Jess, who was AWESOME.  Our other server (I want to say Molly... she is the assistant to Dan) was also AWESOME.  They were so nice and personable and really concerned with making sure everything was perfect.

The planning was easy, the staff is wonderful, the food is great, the restaurant is adorable and in a great location.  I would recommend to anyone planning an event that they check out West Ave Grille.  It is laid back and intimate."

The small brisket plate is a great option--brisket plus 2 sides--I like the cowboy beans (spicy baked beans) and slaw.  Also, the chicken quesadilla isn''t what you would normally expect.  Chicken is SO spicy, and it''s pulled right off the bone.  It''s fantastic.  The brisket tacos are amazing, and my all-time favorite is the shrimp diablo--a shrimp stuffed into a jalapeno with cream cheese, and wrapped with bacon.  Your mouth will be on FIRE but it''s totally worth it!  

I take away a star because the only location for Judge Bean''s is now in Greer Stadium, where the Sounds play.  If you go to a game, be sure to go up to the restaurant on the 4th floor!  The 12th Avenue location is, sadly, closed."

My friend scheduled this tour in advance for my group of 5 our first night staying in the French quarter. Out of all the things I was told to do in NOLA, going on a haunted tour was the top of our list! We met the tour guide on the corner of a busy area outside a small grocery store. The only thing I might say that was confusing was the other groups that were doing a haunted tour the same time we were and were meeting in the same vicinity. We approached the other group by accident and said we were there for the 5 in 1 tour, the man who for the other tour company told us we were in the wrong place and made very negative comments about our tour guide and the company we had signed up for. Honestly it just made HIS company look bad that he would say that to someone. 

Anywho, the tour was awesome-not going to give any of it away because the stories are best told by the Bone Lady herself. She was so animated and knowledgeable and while other reviewers have said negative comments about the tour, they probably just weren''t paying attention (which is hard to do on a Friday night in the French quarter) 

At the very end of the tour our group approached the bone lady to tell her how much we enjoyed the tour, she told us about her cemetery tour which was taking place on Sunday. We signed up with her right then and there! SERIOUSLY go on both of these tours, you won''t regret it! 

One more comment about the negative reviews, you''ll notice a couple people say it''s boring: it''s not! It''s a 5 in 1 tour that lasts 2 hours, there''s a TON of history to go over and if you''re chatting or not paying attention you will miss all of the stories!"

She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that''s showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho.

This morning, my wife and I were leaving to go home and decided on brunch.  I ordered the steak and eggs.  It comes with a side and fruit salad.  The steak was about a 6 oz. ribeye which I ordered medium-rare with eggs over-easy.  Service was excellent and our meal was delivered promptly despite the fact that the restaurant and bar were at full capacity.  Biting into the steak I was amazed.  It was char-grilled to perfection, tender and sooo flavorful.  Completely unlike most breakfast steaks you get.  I daresay this steak was better than many I''ve had at high-end chop houses!  The eggs were perfect.  While the hashbrowns were OK, I am not a fan.  They were quartered new potatoes with a batter that was sugared.  Hashbrowns shouldn''t be sweet!  Overall a tremendous experience gastronomically.  Katie''s usually has a lot of specialty dishes off the menu (Check the chalkboards at the doorways), but if you''re there for breakfast/brunch - get the steak & eggs!"

1) When i first go to check in the young lady at the front desk is on the phone tying to figure out where her lunch is and why its taking so long to get to her (not sure why i needed to know this) I go to check-in and since i paid for the room via hotel. com i didn''t bring my credit card into the hotel the young lady with as much attitude as she could muster while fighting through her hunger pains says to me Really you should know that ANY MAJOR hotel requires a credit card. I know this but since i paid ahead of time i just brought my id into the hotel for check-in.
So strike 1 is the rude staff in a MAJOR hotel!

2) My fiance and I go to room #220 and as soon as we walk in it is very clear that the room had recently been vacated (bed not made trash in various places in the room towels on the floor). 
So Strike 2 is in a MAJOR'' hotel you would think that the rooms we are assigned would be clean!

3)When we are finally assigned a room that has been cleaned. I examine the bathroom and it is VERY clear that room #204''s bathroom has had some kind of water damage (white marks on the wall behind the toilet) grout missing from the corners on the edge of the lip of the shower. 
So strike 3 is the crappy state of the bathroom in a MAJOR hotel!

4) I get back to the hotel after a night out for New Years Eve partying with my fiance and there are literally about 50 to 60 people just standing outside of there cars in the flow of traffic did i forget to mention that its 2:00am? I understand that its New Years but security at a MAJOR hotel should have ensured that the people who were leaving the hotel bar actually left since parking is so very tight at this location. I had to park 1 row from the Sheraton that is on the other end of the parking lot.
So Strike 4 is bad crowd management at a MAJOR hotel. I mean its New Years Eve the hotel should have anticipated this and provided more staff.

5) So I get to the 2nd floor and there are another 20 to 30 people just arbitrarily standing in front of various rooms MINE included. There is a very clear smell of Marijuana and alcohol and again i know is New years so i mostly ignore this only to realize that the room all of these people are coming from is next door to mine! Needless to say i could here every swear laugh and argument that went on in that room. I tried to call the front desk to complain but the room phone gave nothing but a busy signal. I walk out of my room at i believe 2:30am to go down to the front desk to make them aware i am told that security is on the way up. I go back to my room for another 15 - 20 minutes of unruly partying did i mention its almost 3 am at this point? I finally call the front desk from my cell phone and i explain to the young lady that  had just come down to complain about the room next to mine...she cuts me off before i can complete my sentence and states that she already called security and they are on the way up **click**. She hung up on me!!!!
Strike 5 extremely understaffed for an obviously very busy holiday while also being extremely RUDE!!!

6) After all of the above complaining security didn''t get up to the room until almost exactly 3 am to quiet the rowdy crowd next door.
Strike 6 it took security almost 45 minutes to respond to a various guests complaints? I spoke to at least 2 other guest from my part of the hotel and they all had been calling about the crowd.

All of that said I would never recommend this hotel to anyone! This was by far the WORST night i have ever spent in a hotel!!!"

Although the estimate was a little higher than others, I was very impressed with the knowledge and professionalism of Jennifer and decided to go with Goldies. The repairs and paint job were outstanding and my car was ready when promised. I''d give the body work an A.

I also paid for an interior and exterior detailing for $250. The air vents and dash area look brand new which is amazing since my car is a 1997. The rubber around the sunroof was missed and I learned the window hadn''t been opened so there was no opportunity to see what needed to be cleaned there. Chips in the paint were touched up. Jennifer said the wax should last for 30 days which I didn''t think was great. I''d give the detailing job a B."

I spent a lot of time working in the Gentilly area/Upper 9th ward and used to stop into Zimmers pretty frequently. It''s a charming family owned and operated spot that is usually jam packed during the lunch rush. If you''re in a rush, it would definitely behoove you to order ahead so you don''t spend your entire lunch break waiting in line. The staff is always very friendly and personable so sometimes, you actually forget how long you were waiting in line. Their marinated crab legs/claws are wonderful but for me, their true standout is the crab cake patty po''boy. I truly feel like it''s the best seafood po''boy in town! It''s incredibly filling (it has 3-4 crab cake patties) and will only run you about 12 bucks.  

Although I only have rave reviews about Zimmers, I am only going to give it 4 stars because of their hours. They are closed Sundays and Mondays and usually close at 6 so if you work a traditional M-F 9-5 you may not really have a chance to experience the magic of Zimmers, as you should."

I''m confused on the high ratings so im wondering if we were here on an off day. Good: smoked salmon, croissants. Bad: everything else. Here are the highlights: Waiter was confused and didn''t know brunch menu very well. Menu said ask Waiter for french toast and eggs Benedict. Waiter says thats not the case but he''d be willing to go to the bar and get for us. Carving station and omelet station was run by one person who was trying not to get overwhelmed. Buffet selection was large but the gravy and clam chowder tasted pretty much the same, as did many of the dishes which was odd. With amazing brunch options like Mere Bulles, Copper Kettle, Ellendales, etc, I''d advise you to bypass this place. Did I mention we never got our drinks refilled and they bussed our table mid-meal?"

The restaurant was busy but we were seated immediately and not long after we were seated our waiter came for drink orders. Nick, our waiter, was very attentive, polite and friendly yet professional.  I did not see anyone working there that looked 14 so perhaps that is why I missed out on the love fest, (I would have filmed that for you all). All but one of the employees I saw were kept busy and acted professional.  There was one, ( a hostess I believe), who was possibly bored (?), and decided to amuse herself by plastering her face to the glass partition while making a few fishy type faces at the diners. While this may have counted as entertainment to some, I would have preferred the love fest that I could have filmed. Admit it. If I had been able to film that you would have watched. I took off a star for the bad entertainment.  Other than that, the place was clean, the food was good and reasonably priced,  Nick was awesome....I would recommend it to others."

There were many homemade dessert options. We tried a generous portioned Chocolate Mousse cake.

Gabe and I went here at his suggestion for his better late than never birthday dinner. One of the few times I''m allowed to pick up the tab ;)
He opted for beer and I opted for wine. Both enjoyable. He got the special which was some kind of sweet and spicy fried chicken. I got the shrimp and grits. The portions were small for those used to large meals but for us, it was perfect. Left room for more beer later. 
Atmosphere was dark and cozy. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. Wait staff was friendly and efficient. Made reservations, arrived early and seated immediately. 
So about those chairs.... They''re super cute but as I leaned over to grabbed my card that leaped off the table, I went down sloooowly. It was funny actually. A manager ran up to see if I was ok. Between my giggles, I told her yes. Glad it wasn''t a first date lol. 
So was it the wine that caused my graceful descend or the unsteady chair? Let''s just say, not 5 mins later, a man at another table fell too....hahaha! I''m blaming the chairs."

Chemex and V60 for pour over fans and freaks, a selection of teas that is decent and some really gross versions of cronuts. They also have some blends and concoctions that are good for the fans of the sugary bombs of Starbucks and that ilk.

The space is pure hipster, simple clean, subway tile and wood, just a handful of tables inside and out and they have free wifi and clean bathrooms. 

Baristas are way friendlier than the surly folks in SF and the west coast and the prices are cheaper too than in the usual hipster towns."

CycleBar has shoes to make for ride as comfortable as possible, awesome music and tv screens in the studio as well as towels at the ready. Be sure to check the weight of the bar at your bike! Could get ugly when that arm part comes along during your ride!

I ordered egg roll and the pho.
Egg rolls came out covered with burn crumbles all over and very drak color of the shell and you could the content pretty much black color as if it was almost burned or at the least fried in the last drop of over used burned oil and I could not posssibly put it in my mouth. When I was explaining that Im concerned things are too burned, the owner lady walked up and snatched the plate away from me without saying anything. I did not know if they ate bringing another one or not. Only after I grabbed my waiter later he said they are not making another one ans would take it off my check. 
Absolutely rude, not communicating, disrespectful of their customers.. 
the only reason I came was because the neighboring miss saigoin restaurant was flooded but I think it''s worth a wait compared to this place if I want to spend any money for pho and walk out feeling happy :("

It arrived in perfect condition and right on time. They''ve improved the shipping on these cakes. I ordered one a few years ago, and the frosting peeled off when I peeled off the plastic wrapping. Not any more! It was just perfect this time!

My other favorite splurge is getting the amazing king cakes at Mardi Gras time. They''re the best! I bring them to work and everyone flips out over them. My daughters in college expect them now too. They get the king cakes, beads, etc, and have gotten lots of attention in the dorms because of them! One daughter said that people will say they will just have a little sliver, then they always come back for more. The baby in the king cake is always a fun topic for Californians to learn about.

MMRRS6YhVRx_iN5-JhMRYg,Han Dynasty,3711 Market St,Philadelphia,PA,19104,783,tPOey7vqiGEazYB96dNccA,4,"Couple of notable impressions:

- The first thing that got me was the decor of the place. Chopsticks were made out of red plastic, and the napkin was just paper, not cloth. Water came out in glass cups. The impression was overall a little cheap, which surprised me. On the other hand, the servers did keep water refilled well and tea was presented immediately.

- A lot of the reviews remark that the dishes are very spicy. I was surprised to discover it was pretty tame. The Dan Dan noodles come in at a 6 and it was imperceptible. We got another dish coming in at an 8 which also was hard to notice. Not sure what the explanation might be since I don''t consider myself to be especially tolerant, but perhaps I''m more so than I think?

- Service was very fast. I think our food came out within ten minutes. Certainly the Dan Dan noodles were instantaneous.

- Finally, the food itself is delicious. The Dan Dan noodles especially. I also had some kind of dumplings and an entree, I unfortunately can''t remember the names, but both were enjoyable as well.

- The bill was a bit pricey. I think they give a lot of food for two, so it''s may be justified, just unwanted for two relatively small people. Fortunately, they make taking it home easy if that''s something you''d like.

EDIT:

- After visiting a second time with a large group, I discovered they have a very nice seating area for groups (to the right and somewhat below ground). We got a circular table which I really liked for discussion. Definitely would have appreciated a turntable, but no big deal.

- A tip from our server: the spice tends to be the kind that creeps up rather than is entirely overt. Besides water, consuming tea and rice helps to reduce the effect of the spice."

Inside it looks more of a classy place.  But sadly, that was the best part of our experience.   Our waiter Mike was just unprofessional, a tad snooty, and slow.  He has a hard time understanding what customer service is, and he tries to push unwanted items from the menu on you.  Maybe he should pay more attention to his customers instead of relaying heavily on the bussers.  They were great.  They brought the bread, the served the food, they kept the glasses filled, and they picked up the plates.  All Mike did was take our order, disappear during the entire meal, and then make us wait a good 10 minutes to bring the check.   

As for the food, it was just okay.  It was hot and fresh, but on the bland side.  Neither myself or my friend finished our meals.  

This place is more show than substance.  There are plenty of other Italian places in this city.  I recommend trying somewhere else."
jLaPtjlLfRSaoBWIcHcSQg,The Mad Crab,8080 Olive Blvd,University City,MO,63130,156,PXz7aOKioHvmne6hv982tg,5,"Well done Saint Louis. I didn''t dream of having a Boiling Crab-esque restaurant out here, but here I am. Mad Crab met my expectations and then some. The whole shabang (aka: whole shebang) medium and mild seasoning was amazing! The half dozen oysters tasted beautifully fresh and the staff were gracious in my requests for salt and pepper and hella limes.

I think this is a great first date place! Take advantage of the fact that you and your date can get messy together in a fun and casual setting! And, if he/she doesn''t like cajun seafood, you know they''re not the one!

My advice to the management, if they read reviews, is to have their wait staff add that extra human touch by tying the bibs for their customers. Boiling Crab does that and that extra little service goes a long way. In addition, consider providing wet wipes for their customers with their check.

Overall, well done and I''ll be sure to recommend Mad Crab to my Saint Louis friends."

The server was really cool and very honest when we asked what was good and fresh for the day.
The food was cooked fresh!  I mean from being alive in the tank to killed and cooked right behind you. 
We ordered Lobster and rock crab both were amazing. We also had the lobster bisque which I thought needed more flavor.

The beer was ice cold and the food was hot and fresh. Service was outstanding once we actually got seated."

There was this amazing salad on the menu that had all my favorite foods.  I ordered a kale salad, served with sauteed butternet squash, prosciutto and topped with sea bass. So good! 

I''d give Smith''s 4 stars, but the service was not the best.  We called in advance to make reservations for a group of 7 and were told they didn''t take reservations.  When we arrived, the first thing we were asked was if we had resevations.  What???  Annoying.  We ended up sitting and waiting, getting very little updates from the hostess.  

Not the best service, but I''d go again for the food."

Upon walking into the restaurant, I stood by the counter/register and waited for someone to come to the front.  A woman walked up from the back of the place and said, ya.  I asked for a to-go menu, received one and left.  I perused the menu in the car and noticed they seen to be priced higher than many other Indian places in the Nashville area.  

Sorry, but ya is not how I prefer to be greeted.  Like I said, I have not eaten at this restaurant.  After this brief encounter, I will not do so.

Also, I find it very interesting that the most recent positive reviews of this restaurant are from folks with Indian names who live in other states."

I was greeted and brought directly to my table immediately (I did make a reservation).  I ordered the Chicken/Filet Tapanyaki with an avocado roll. Salad was a bit too garlicky for my taste.  Soup was hot and tasty (metal spoon and not a traditional spoon).  Avocado Roll was great!

Dinner - Good show.  Very personable chef.  Talented.  Fried rice is the norm (no upcharge).  Veggies were hot and still crunchy."

I pretty much get the same thing every time (jerk chicken with cabbage, peas and rice and plantains), but EVERYTHING they serve is good, from the basa fish to the brown stew chicken to the oxtails to the... well, you get the picture. 

And the price-to-portion-size ratio is awesome.
For eight bucks I get a Styrofoam container with the meal I mentioned earlier that is so full it will barely close.  
The young lady who prepared our order on my most recent visit had to force the boxes closed and double bag them just so we could get them home without them bursting open.  And we ordered the SMALL portions.

Now, as with any restaurant with good food it goes without saying that word travels.  As a result this place is always packed. ALWAYS. 
The line remains at two lengths: at the door or out the door.  So if you''re impatient or adhering to the fast food mentality when it comes to restaurants, you may want to go elsewhere. 

But if you are willing to wait, it''s oh so worth it."

This one in particular is small but mighty. There''s a respectable wine and beer section, quite the array of cheeses (which is a huge reason you go to a Trader Joe''s type grocery, let''s be honest)*, and solid offerings of both prepared or cut and whole produce.

Champagne grapes for cheap. So happy.

dIpTuL2T1L98GQGU17IeSw,The Bricks,1327 E 7th Ave,Tampa,FL,33605,548,miIwXNa5O-ILZaN_S3EH2g,4,"I''m definitely a fan.  The food/drinks are always stellar and while the staff is super friendly, the only issue with The Bricks is the time it takes to order/be served.  

It isn''t like the servers are slow either, they are clearly working their assess off running from table to table, so maybe it is that people have called in sick the couple of times I''ve been in recently and they had to work twice as hard but a Sunday lunch shouldn''t take 3 hours.  

Now that my complaining is out of the way, the restaurant itself is super groovy.  The kitchen is on full display so no crazy stories of chefs putting anything crazy into your food here.  And they look like they are having a great time while they prepare meals (whether they are or not, I love to see people enjoy what they do).  I normally get draft beer but their cocktails look really interesting and innovative.  

At lunch, I normally get the Goodness which is a hummus wrap and it comes with a choice of a side ($8).  Don''t bother being wishy-washy on the side, get the Asian slaw, it is delicious, and if available I would order as a meal.  The wrap was good but the star was the slaw.  Thai, pea-nutty, goodness:)

I''ve gotten the Elvis before ($8) and it was delicious but something I can make a home.  I ordered it without bacon.  

My husband ordered the burrito and loved it as well ($9).  Others at our table raved about the Chicken and the Pig, The BBQ pork, and The Cure sandwiches.  Everyone really liked their food.  

The Bricks really is a great spot on the 7th Avenue strip, perfect for late night people watching that make Ybor awesome and also out of the way enough to not feel like it''s distinctly part of the Ybor scene."

Not to mention I also had 2 mattress sets, a room of carpet, a broken sofa AND an old door that needed to be dumped. 

Called Tobey''s and was asked to text the information about my job to them.  Scheduled an appointment on my day off. They arrived a little after 9am and left around 1130 and did a great job of hauling off everything! What a weight off my shoulders to not have to worry about all of that crap. 

Would def recommend Tobey''s and if we were to need their services again in the Reno/Sparks area I would totally hire them again!

The best part about a chimi is that buttery n flaky crust on the tortilla and the moist shredded chicken with a delicious portion of peppers which sadly they do not ad just beans and chicken, one thing that really pressed my buttons was the first time I came they knocked over my cup when the set down my plate and completely soaked my little sisters food in tea and proceeded to charge us for another meal! But on to the good why them deserve 4 stars. After having a not so great chimi I decided to try my own take and orders a side of grilled shrimp, lettuce, queso, tortillas and rice. I''m picky at times so I opted for a make my own kind of taco and for 8$ for rather large pieces of shrimp that come with 13 of those yummy boys I''m in heaven! There salsa is just so delicious and you can taste the fresh tomatoes in it and the queso is so mouth watering and that''s coming from a lactose intolerant!

It is dirty. Really dirty. And a lot of attractions are in pretty lousy shape.

The air conditioning is barely holding on. It is a super hot day, but c''mon, I shouldn''t be sweating buckets just sitting and my kids are so hot we''re headed out after being here a half hour :/

It is pretty cheap, but not worth it when the conditions are so rough that we can''t stay and play. We were the only ones here on a weekday afternoon, I guess everyone else has already figured out what a dump it is.

Edited to add: I let the kids get a few tokens from the token machine on the way out. The machine spit out tokens that the games wouldn''t take and management wouldn''t give us new ones saying that those aren''t jungle wonder tokens. (Even though I got them from the machine in jungle wonder.) 

Never again."

They are trendy and modern. The decor is beautiful. I love that they are pet friendly and don''t charge extra fees. They have peanut butter flavored treats for your pet at check-in . They can also provide you with a loaner pet bed, water bowl, mat and even food if you forget. 

The rooms are clean and airy. Each room comes with a free yoga mat and umbrella. You can also borrow a bike to ride around the city. 

The staff are friendly and make sure you feel welcomed. A complimentary happy hour is hosted everyday from 5-6pm and free coffee and tea in the morning.

There are a lot of homeless in that area so definitely use caution. When we were walking a homeless man came charging towards us which was scary.

Just look at the labels and realize what you are getting. You pay more, but you pay for what you get, and that''s a lot. Want organics and quality? Incredible fruit and veggies section. Amazing beer and wine (my mouth watered at the $450 bottle of Dom Perignon!) There is amazing looking sushi prepared fresh. I bought a tiny baguette that is the freshest and tastiest bread I have ever eaten. The selection is amazing, you will find things from all over the world. They get rare and unusual items so it costs more. 

I don''t think AJs is snobby. I did get some weird looks from the employees when I showed up in my ratty shirt and shoes, but I know what I want there and get great quality things that go into my body. And there are better and better deals the more you show up, just like any other grocery store. I''d rather get some things here than anywhere else in town. AJ''s is a place to explore more. And there are no homeless people or ghetto customers in line , which I love!

I probably can''t or won''t shop here too often since, you know, I like to pay rent and bills and stuff. But for specialty items and rarer beers and things, this is the place. It''s also fun to browse. Totally good times."

Because this place has one of the most generous menus as far as choices go.  There is a ton to choose from, even if you''re vegetarian.  
Formalities first--why can''t there be some ambiance at Indian restaurants.  I know I''m painting with broad strokes here, but it seems like outside of NYC, no Indian restaurant in the US can get creative with their dining space.  Not sure why that is, but whatever.
An early arrival on a Sunday found the place quiet, with maybe 10 or so people dining.  No problem getting a table for 2.  We started the evening off with some garlic Naan.  Delicious, although I think next time I''ll stick with regular, at almost half the cost.  We also got some Finger Paneer, little spiced fried cubes of cheese.  These were denser than typical Paneer.  The cheese was slightly bland, but the spices were good.  Overall, an enjoyable start to the meal.  I also had a lemonade, which may have been made fresh.  Regardless, it was tasty. 
Entrees included Paneer Bhurji and Lamb Shahi Korma.  We elected spicy as our seasoning level.  I''ll admit, I have a pretty strong ability to deal with spiciness.  But this was some ultra-spicy food when it arrived!  We quickly ordered a mango lassi to help put out the fire.  Still, even through the spices, there were decent flavors coming through.  The nutiness of the Korma was especially nice, as was the blended creaminess.
I''m intrigued enough to return for more offerings.  I am humbled however by their spiciness--something that has not happened to me in many many years.  Next time, I am going to stick with medium spiciness!"

We decided to go for Sunday brunch, and could not have been more pleased. We were initially concerned with the 25 minute wait outside, but were pleased when they called us after just 10 minutes. 

I had the French toast which was outstanding, and my sister ordered the grilled cheese, which was one of the best she''s ever had.

Their food is spicy, yet amazingly flavorful and the ambiance is sure to encourage a fun conversation with those you share your meal with (you''ll definitely need a glass of water the first time you visit to handle the sexy heat). For what is expected of Chinese food, it is on the pricier side, but all well worth it.  My favorite recommendations include Dan Dan noodles, Dry Pepper Chicken/Shrimp, and Cumin Lamb.  The service can be slow during busier days such as Friday/Saturday/Sunday, but the waiters/waitresses are very friendly making the wait forgivable."

I just had their Beefy Crunch Burrito, XXL Grilled Stuft Burrito, and a Meximelt. I shudder to think how may Weight Watchers points I just ate.  But it was goooood.  I hadn''t been at this particular Taco Bell in a long time.  It''s nice and clean, service was fast and the staff behind the counter very courteous.  

I''m not going to debate the merits of Taco Bell food as Mexican food.  I''ve had authentic Mexican food, and this is obviously not it.  If you are looking for authenticity, something like Miguel''s or Carmelita''s or Vallarta''s is a lot closer.

They do have some healthy options, which I recall from a while back and was nice to see them again.  Their Fresco items basically remove the cheese and sour cream and stick to salsa and lettuce as toppings.  It is actually possible to eat a couple of Fresco Tacos and stick to a strict Weight Watchers diet.

I''ll try that tomorrow."

My issue here is the guests. There are a couple people that live here. So if you were planning on sitting in one of the cozy chairs think again. They''ve basically claimed them as their own. Take a close look and you can see their ass prints in each seat. Seriously. And on a nice afternoon there''s usually 5-10 too many highschoolers hanging around. They tend to sit outside around the Cold Stone next door which is a little bit of a relief. Where do these kids get money for Starbucks everyday?

It tastes fresh and refreshing, and will fill you up. My recommendation for chaat: go for the mild, even if you like really spicy food. It''s not because it''s super spicy (it still has a kick though) but because the balance of flavors is better with the mild chaat. The spicy chaat, the spiciness overpowers the rest of the goodies and it gets a bit too saucy for me. As for lassis, I''ve had the mango, rose, and mint - all I would recommend."

They really need to re-think the brunch menu and serve items from their good at.  I never had dinner her although I would assume it is better than the brunch items.  I had the meatball omelette which was just ok.  I would say anywhere else would have better omelets. My husband had the burger with an egg on it.  He thought it was good but there are better burgers out there.  I should have went with my gut instinct after seeing the brunch menu but decided to stay since it was Joe Madden's restaurant.  I say skip this place and go down the street to Goody Goody.

The mushroom soup was good, the rest was downhill! The small crab cake -most at the table didn''t eat. The chicken breast was okay as were the mashed potatoes! Oddly the rolls they served with the meal were sweet with honey on them. Not a fan! The worst part was the service!

They have an eccentric mix of IPA''s and Pale Ales. The menu is very interesting as well; their buffalo wings and the cavetelli appetizer were both amazing..the cavetelli was served al dente with amazing flavor. I had the skate for my dinner, which was probably the most delicious fish I''ve had in as long as I can remember. 

They are known for their burgers, which were very good as well. They are often compared to Village Whiskey''s burger, and sadly I don''t think they are quite on par, but still very good.

This place is on the pricier side, but the ambiance on a Saturday night is a mixed crowd; noisy and full of energy. Nicely done!"

This place not be what you expect when you pull up because it looks very motel-ish.  The rooms are very clean.  They have a nice little pool area.  They have wine and cheese at night and breakfast in the morning.

I''ve had Thai from a lot of the places around Brandon and typically I wind up disappointed.....most places aren''t authentic and just really lack. This was not the case for Jasmine Thai. The main reason I took the star is because their crab rangoons were a bit dry. But my husband had the Chicken Basil and I had the Chicken Panang Curry and they were both wonderful. Also I must comment on the decor inside, they could use new carpeting but other than that it was one of the nicest Thai restaurants I''ve seen."

I''ll gladly make the trek from south city to O''Fallon to get this delicious, superior and value Thai.

Having been twice, I am ashamed to admit that I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles so I have had that each visit, albeit once chicken and once pork.

The appetizers are delicious.  Have tried the spring rolls, chicken satay and chicken pot-stickers and they were all satisfying.

The waiter/waitress will ask you what level you want your heat if you get a spicy dish.  They ask you on a scale of 1 to 4.  First visit I asked for 3 and the dish was very nice.  Last visit I went 4 and while it was definitely a sinus opening experience the food is pleasantly hot without any of the ill side-effects later on...if you know what I mean.

The menu has over 100 items on it and while some of the other reviews complain of the vegetables being not fresh I can only compare Aroy with the pricey city Thai I''ve had in/around St Louis and I put Aroy equal of better with HUGE portion sizes at very reasonable prices.

Each visit I have found the service to be attentive and available.  Once during Saturday lunch rush and another post-lunch afternoon.

Walk-in takeout service seemed very quick for those I observed on my visits.

I''ve been to Thailand a few times and while you''ll never beat home-cooked Thai with exported fare, I have nothing bad to say about Aroy Thai.  It''s where I''ll be taking my out-of-town guests and where I''ll go for takeout when the urge hits. 

Looking forward to my next visit to explore more of their menu choices...unless those Drunken Noodles get me again!"

If you are uncomfortable in a diversely ethnic and racial environment than this place isn''t for you. We have a blended family (Caucasian and Latino) and are from Brooklyn, Queens, and the Lower East Side & Harlem. We felt as if we were in our normal elements around the way and not 2 hours away from home in an otherwise non-descript South West Jersey town. Contrary to some who use the word ghetto to represent the clientele here, it''s simply not the case. Again, it''s ethnically and racially diverse- mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins and friends - all trying to have the best time they could during their time off from work!

I felt that there was plenty of parental supervision, I noticed only seniors/elderly family members sitting off on the sides and most parents/guardians aged from 18 to 60 were actively waking around and/or with their children in the water environment.

Paid $25 (due to googling Sahara Sam promo code) per ticket and felt this was a very fair price for the amenities offered.

Took a star away because there needs be better instruction at the front door advising what needs to be done if you are either a 1)season ticket holder, 2) walk up purchaser, or 3) online purchaser and what you must do if you have bags with you. Basically you go inside if you already have your tickets with or without bags to convert them to wristbands at the counter. Everyone with bags must go inside for a bag check. Someone outside would have saved about 8 minutes of my families time and probably the time of countless other confused souls.

The facility appearing well maintained overall - paint fresh and vivid, not chipping, no rust visible.

It was clean. The water appeared clean and hygienic relative to the amount of people present.

It gets busy, I would say about 90% capacity, the earlier the better. The ability to use the outdoor facility helps balance the flow between areas.

The smell of chlorine is there, I''d say play inside for a bit, go outside get some air, then come back in...remember - your in a normally enclosed area (even tho the roof does open).

Staff appeared helpful with flow of smaller children, life guards were attentive to children in water areas - felt safe. Seen many genuine smiles from The staff.

Didn''t purchase food there - left it in the car and went out to eat it at the car, no food or drinks allowed from the outside inside the facility - which makes sense to protect their business interest - but they let you do as you place in the parking area! Plus, their price list is available as a picture on Yelp - scroll through - and if you don''t
Like the prices bring sandwiches or go down the
Block to McDonalds - otherwise deal with the prices and food quality - it''s a water park not a gourmet restaurant!

We will go back again as it is a good value for $25 each ticket (use the discount promo codes online)!! 

The kids loved it. No complaints from them.

And you get drinks at the bar and can bring them throughout the facility (Long Island Iced Tea $9.50 - best value for alcohol served)."

They also forgot to spray my fragrance that I paid for. The manager had to come and wipe my car over again and spray. Even after that I still wasn't satisfied it was just an overall bad job. I gave them 2 stars because my interior was clean.

So we did. Walked around for a bit and saw this place. Pretty simple menu. I haven''t had a po boy yet so I ordered the buffalo shrimp po boy, which came with fries and cole slaw. The folks behind the counter were very friendly. 

He po boy was amazing, granted I haven''t had one before to compare it with. The shrimp was breaded just right, the bread was soft, and the hint of buffalo sauce and blue cheese crumbs were perfect. 

The fries were breaded and seasoned just the way I liked it. Didn''t have a chance to try the coleslaw because I think I forgot."

Also, the front desk representatives were friendly. Those are the positives. The main reason for the 2 stars is the housekeeping staff. Both mornings of our stay we were awoken by someone from the housekeeping staff at 8:30am trying to open our door DESPITE the Do Not Disturb sign being on the door. The second morning we were first woken up at 7am by an alarm that we did not set. It was not set the first day and was the second...and we absolutely did not set it (didn''t need an alarm).  Cleanliness of the room was average at best, but it was the ignoring of the DND sign and the setting of the alarms that will prevent us from booking here again."

My sister ordered a drink off the menu and 10+min later, as we''re finishing our lunch, the waitress comes back and says sorry, our bartender doesn''t know how to make that ..... So the bartender doesn''t know how to make the drinks listed on the menu? And the 10+mins. it took to tell us that, it could have ben googled and made. I don''t want to bash this establishment, but the customer service has always been an issue here.

As soon as we arrived, they had our seat ready and they were expecting us.

Our meals were tasty, I had the Chicken or the Egg special, and loved the $15 bottomless drinks, which you could switch out between a bloody mary, mimosa and sangria for no extra cost. Our waitress was very friendly.

To top it all off, the owner/head chef visited our table as he knew we were the people from Facebook.

The waiter skipped the second course entirely, and then said it wasn''t a course at all when we pointed this out.  We sought clarification and the waiter was indeed wrong and did not understand the set menu.  Another waiter stepped in, offered to serve the second course after the third, and to give us complimentary champagne, more wine, money off our check, and extra food.  

The solution was not ideal - the order of dishes was off, we did not really want the extras, and the champagne was horrid, but it was New Year''s Eve and we wanted a pleasant evening, so said fine.  Most of the dishes were excellent. However, our final tab did not show the promised deduction.  

Overall, a bit of a disappointment."

He is very well known in Santa Barbara and it was always reassuring to hear that he was great to work with! His recommendations and sage advice kept us in line and on target with what we wanted. We were very particular about A LOT of aspects of the wedding and he really was amazing at negotiating and compromising with our goals in mind.

In retrospect, I should have been overjoyed, because I would have had an excellent excuse to post up in the dingy (charming?) dining room and eat so many shrimp tacos I couldn''t breath. It would have been worth it, because they''re awesome. 

During dinner, $8.00 and tax gets you three tacos of your choice, beans, rice, pickled onions and radishes, limes, and a 16 oz. cup of fresh juicy heaven. I went with shrimp, my husband mixed it up with fish and shrimp. Lemme break it down: 

Tortillas: Fresh, handmade, substantial without being dense. Impossibly moist and flexible. How are these not crumbling apart in my hand? This is a tortilla that can stand up to some serious manhandling, which is exactly what I did to my tacos. I would like to note that I would manhandle these on their own as a snack, or filled with cheese and green chiles. 

Shrimp: Crispy until the end. Moderately battered. I won''t say lightly - someone''s dragging these through the batter with a heavyish hand, but I''m happy to say they''re cooked perfectly and thoroughly enough that you don''t encounter any flavorless globs of doughy disappointment. Just pure, deep fried ecstasy. 

Sauce: White sauce of indeterminable origin. Mayonnaise? Vinegar? Crema? DELICIOUS. Cooly, tangy, and sour in the best way possible. Really the great unifier - bringing together while still accentuating the hot, crispy, shrimp, crunchy cabbage, and dense corn tortilla. 

Beans & Rice: Solid. Substantial. You''re going to eat them. 

Horchata: Dude said people show up just for the horchata and I believe him. This doesn''t come out of a fountain, and I''m not just saying that because I watched as it got ladled out of some giant tub resting on the counter top. You can taste the rice. This drink has texture, and what appears to be giant, lovely flecks of cinnamon bark. 

Pina/Mango Juice: Fortifying. So tasty. Chunks of fresh pineapple. This might be my new Gatorade. 

Taqueria Pico De Gallo, come onnnnnnnn. Why so good?"

I call it family style as I feel like I am eating at a Hispanic friend''s house and their grandma is cooking. They have a bunch of fresh quick favorites in the steam table like roast pork and yellow rice or black beans and rice, but today I picked something I have had there before and loved, chicken fingers. I know crazy right? But it''s the best and always fresh made. They make it like my grandma, fresh breaded and quick fried. That and a side of rice and nice big bowl of their amazing Spanish Bean soup/ garbanzo and I am in culinary heaven. This is my go to place for great comfort food. Cubans are pretty good here too. But I go there on the days when they have Spanish Bean soup and I would put theirs up against any of the good ones in Ybor City, yes it is that good, but sadly not on the menu every day.

I don''t know which I liked better, the owner or the ham croqueta sandwich.  He was super friendly, making sure to talk to everyone and was happy he didn''t have to deport anyone for not liking his food, which I don''t think is possible.

The sandwich was bigger than I expected and loaded.  There was more ham on it than I normally eat at Christmas dinner, yet at the end, I was somehow wanting more.  The black bean soup was the perfect side dish.  Pro tip: check out coupons4indy.com before you go!

Visited Carmine''s on a weekend trip to Missouri after reading the its reviews on Yelp. Can''t say I had the same experience as other yelpers this time around...

While the service was spot-on (I don''t think my water glass was ever less than 3/4 full), the quality of food just didn''t meet my steakhouse expectations. My brother had the porterhouse. I tried the seafood special - prawns stuffed with crab and grilled. There really wasn''t anything special about my meal or the risotto it was served with. Both were bland. My bad I suppose for ordering seafood in a restaurant known for steaks, although my brother''s medium steak came out practically bleeding and was sent back for a second round on the grill. 

One positive... the toasted ravioli. Yummm! Wish I had just ordered a second plate for dinner."
