Bland, bland, bland, burnt, and awful. Love Indian food. I wish this approximated it.

Our order consisted of fairly pedantic fare, as far as Indian goes:

-pappadam...not on menu they went to the Nepalese place across the street to buy it...chutney. ...noooope
- chicken tikka (date ordered it , don't judge) tasted like tomato soup with tandoori chix
- chicken jalfreizi, ordered Indian spicy, had canned veggies in it, in a broth - like substance, unedible
- Naan- was ABC and dry, oh and burnt-to-beat-the-band.
- garlic kulcha- only edible item. Tho it was neither garlic or kulcha

All for the low, low price of 70 cold stones.

Friday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling ""you're welcome"" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. 

Saturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it ""should be"". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is ""not their job"". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, ""not my job"" attitudes take you far!

It sounds delicious, but what I received left quite a bit to be desired. 

The potatoes were well cooked but lack any sort of seasoning, the spinach was non-existent (like, there was no spinach), the eggs over-poached to the point of having hard yolks (may have been because of the 5 minute trip from the restaurant to my work, but they would have had to have been overcooked in the first place to end up this hard), less cheese than you would find on a steak sandwich at a kosher deli, and, wait for it, a bland and flavorless country gravy in place of my hollandaise.

It's not that the food is inedible, but for the (lack of) quantity and flavor, $12.50 is a steep price to pay for something that will leave you disappointed through-out the morning.

This past time though, I had multiple issues.  One day our room didn't get cleaned until 4:45 (and we hadn't had anything out saying to leave us alone.)  Also there were loud guests in the room next to us.  I called the front desk at 11:20 pm three times and let the phone ring and ring-no answer.  I called from my cellphone and voila!  He picked up and said he would check on things in 5 minutes.  I wrote to them about the disappointing experience and received this in response from the manager:
 
""Sometimes smaller properties are not a good fit for everyone and I apologize that you felt our night auditor was not doing his job trying to quiet down disruptive guests.  He is not able to carry the hotel phone with him when out on the property, hence not immediately picking up your call when you initially rang to complain.
 
We try our best everyday to take care of all of our guests. I am sorry that we fell short for you and hope that you will be able to find a property here in Paradise in the future that better suits your needs.""
 
I can't understand why, with today's technology, that the night person couldn't carry a phone around the (small) property?  And if he had truly been walking around the property, he should have heard the commotion going on in the room next to us.

Being open that late is honestly the only reason I'm adding 1 star to this establishment. 

Unfortunately the food doesn't translate to being anything good, especially the Pizza where I've heard it's decent. I ordered the whole pepperoni pizza, garlic knots, and ""garlic"" fries. It didn't take more than a few minutes upon eating that this would be really nasty to eat sober.

I didn't even have much expectations, but for it to take 30 minutes with moderately low crowds and result in an overlooked and super greasy pizza, ew. It was more like pizza goo since the toppings just slid right off the pizza. 

Garlic knots are just breadsticks, which doesn't even have the quality that Little Caesars makes them. 

While the garlic fries weren't even garlicy at all- a complete waste of an extra dollar, R.I.P.- the portion was very large for $4 fries that tastes about the same as McDonalds, which isn't too bad.

Came back into town for Fiesta and met with cousins from all over took em to all the best spots and then one terrible spot. So after my large group of cousins get in, including myself. After paying way too much money for a Heineken (7.75 and it was barely cold), and we realize we are missing someone. I go outside to find one cousin stuck outside because the doorman is uncomfortable with my cousins California ID AND Driver's license. Apparently if you confuse a muscle bound doorman, he gets skiddish and won't let you join your group. So his boss shows up, claims he ate a whole meal (it was ice cream) then walked around the club and because we were in there for 20 minutes (actually just 3 songs, I can tell you this because each song choice was worse than the last) so we can't get a refund to rejoin our cousin to go elsewhere. After logically, and calmly pleading our case. The boss man (who's mind was made up way before he even told me his reasoning behind keeping our group fissured, and our money in his cash drawer) that the doorman is his guy, and he's gonna back him up, even though the doorman initially asked him for help when he realized he couldn't read good. I even suggested he review the digital security footage, would surely could be queued up immediately as this is 2014 and we could prove we had been in for 20 minutes or less. I was told, as he chuckled ""I can't even do that until next week"". I even suggested that he have the 2 police officers who were entering his club, the verify the validity of my cousins ID, and that too, was not acceptable to this doorman. So overpriced beer, shitty music, terrible security staff, and a strong desire to turn away business (I explained we were a large group, ready to purchase many drinks) have earned this joint 1 star. That one star is for the cute cashier in the poncho who asked me how my day was going. Other than that, this sticky floored night club is underwhelming at best. Perhaps if the doorman wasn't beaten in the side of his head on the regular (cauliflower ears, usually a sign of being a crappy MMA fighter), then maybe he could determine the difference between California ID and a driver's license, it is his job after all.

The fried rice and chow mein were very MEH. I feel as though that should be the staple of any Chinese restaurant - the fried rice did not have much taste at all and the rice tasted a little bit stale. The chow mein just did not taste good at all - I can't quite tell you what was wrong with it but I just did not like it. The orange chicken we ordered was very flavorful (albeit strong MSG tasting) and the other entrees were flavorful as well. 

Problem was - I had to drink a gallon of water afterwards to rehydrate myself. That evening, my stomach just hurt a little bit.

Boy_Wm0DEo4dp0aaBaT4xQ,zJIpM80K_6C6XMmgeBjdSg,QZU7TcrztBb3tXaPbVCkXg,1,5,1,0,"I am updating my review and demoting my completely rookie piercing experience at 805 from a 2 star to a 1.  Why?  Well, I'm glad I asked!  

As you can see from my first review, I wasn't very happy with this piercing from the beginning.  My recently pierced tragus became infected.  I went to a different piercer to take a look at the situation and immediately I could tell he was NOT impressed with this job.  He noticed that it was too close to my face and uneven with my other tragus piercing, which was something I convinced myself I'd have to live with.  He even mentioned something about it being pierced at a bad angle and wasn't surprised at all that it got infected by the way it was pierced.  He tried being diplomatic, but the look on his face said otherwise.  In so many words said that he would have done everything about it differently.

He gave me a couple options.  I could take it out, let it heal, and start over OR I could power through and hope for the best.  I opted to let it heal and start over.  When he took the jewelry out (which was the same piece that I was pierced with) he was quite shocked that a reputable place such as 805 would have pierced me with such a cheap piece of jewelry that had plastic on the backing.  Plastic harbors bacteria, and bacteria is something you absolutely want to avoid when getting pretty new holes jabbed into your body.

So, the lesson of the day here is: do not get pierced at 805!  

If you are brave enough to ignore my warning and decide to do so anyway, just make sure you get someone else and avoid the girl that pierced me.  I don't know her name, but if you see a youngish girl (in her early 20's I'm guessing) with long, straight hair approach you, run out the door or she will go amateur-hour on you!  

Now I'm just going to hit the reset button, burn some sage and goosfrabba, and continue on with a real-deal piercer who knows how it goes.",2015-12-23 23:32:51,805 Ink,1228 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4241297,-119.7053211,4.5,68,1,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True'}","Beauty & Spas, Tattoo","{'Monday': '12:0-20:0', 'Tuesday': '12:0-20:0', 'Wednesday': '12:0-20:0', 'Thursday': '12:0-20:0', 'Friday': '12:0-20:0', 'Saturday': '12:0-20:0', 'Sunday': '12:0-18:0'}",0,updating review demoting completely rookie piercing experience star well glad asked see first review happy piercing beginning recently pierced tragus became infected went different piercer take look situation immediately could tell impressed job noticed close face uneven tragus piercing something convinced would live even mentioned something pierced bad angle surprised got infected way pierced tried diplomatic look face said otherwise many word said would done everything differently gave couple option could take let heal start could power hope best opted let heal start took jewelry piece pierced quite shocked reputable place would pierced cheap piece jewelry plastic backing plastic harbor bacteria bacteria something absolutely want avoid getting pretty new hole jabbed body lesson day get pierced brave enough ignore warning decide anyway make sure get someone else avoid girl pierced know name see youngish girl early guessing long straight hair approach run door go amateurhour going hit reset button burn sage goosfrabba continue realdeal piercer know go

Soon after we last dined there (see January review), a renovation took place.  We were eager to return anticipating the same consistent excellent food, service and ambience like we had many times over the past years.  The restaurant was full with the exception of couple of empty tables.  This is not unusual for Zen Yai.  The cosmetic make over was obviously different.  While seated and waited for 20 minutes just for water, we noticed that most of the tables were waiting for their water too with no hint of  food to come.  We noticed a change of staff and manager also.  We wonder if the owner sold the restaurant to someone else, and changed the cooks as well????  Because they were definitely not keeping up with any of the customers just sitting and waiting.  Two tables finally got there food and we wondered how long they waited.  We decided we didn't want to spend the next undetermined hours to find out as we wanted to enjoy the rest of the evening doing more than just waiting for food.  We're not at all fond of the new make-over either.  Before the ambience was eccentric in a fun eclectic way.  Now it's cookie cutter bland, not at all interesting.  For now, we'll see if more consistent good reviews will come about on their food, then we'll give it another try.",2018-09-04 01:31:51,Zen Yai Thai Cuisine,425 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4162591,-119.6952494,4.0,347,1,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'BYOBCorkage': ""'no'"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsTableService': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'quiet'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'None', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': None, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': None, 'divey': False, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True'}","Thai, Restaurants, American (New), Pop-Up Restaurants, Asian Fusion","{'Tuesday': '17:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '17:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '17:0-21:0', 'Friday': '17:0-21:45', 'Saturday': '17:0-21:45', 'Sunday': '17:0-21:0'}",0,july update soon last dined see january review renovation took place eager return anticipating consistent excellent food service ambience like many time past year restaurant full exception couple empty table unusual zen yai cosmetic make obviously different seated waited minute water noticed table waiting water hint food come noticed change staff manager also wonder owner sold restaurant someone else changed cook well definitely keeping customer sitting waiting two table finally got food wondered long waited decided want spend next undetermined hour find wanted enjoy rest evening waiting food fond new makeover either ambience eccentric fun eclectic way cookie cutter bland interesting see consistent good review come food give another try

To find this place you have to walk all the way to the end of Stearn's Wharf which is no big deal because we were already there.  By no means is this the only restaurant in the area but since we were on the wharf I pulled it up on Yelp and it had many, many favorable reviews. So we thought...let's give it a shot.  

Upon arrival, you place your name on a list hanging from the post just outside the entrance to the restaurant.   You can indicate eating indoors, at  one of the few tables outdoors, or first available.  We were in no rush and it was a nice afternoon so we opted for outdoors.  The restaurant is very small with even fewer tables outside. Service was below par.  The waiter even apologized and self-admitting he ""forgot about us"" after leaving us for 10 minutes and not returning to take our order.

The menu is typical seafood with specialization in crab and lobster. My two kids were with me and unfortunately their taste buds aren't at the level to pick from the menu. I asked the waiter if they offered a kids'  menu...they got three choices chicken dinos, grilled cheese sandwhich, or pasta. I opted for the crabcakes and my husband for the shrimp tacos.

I wish I had read Steve I's review...I couldn't agree more with his description of the crab cakes.  I would assume that if you are calling a dish ""crab cakes"" that there would be some crab in it? Maybe?  They were a mushy mess.  Could not find lumps of crab nor taste the crab.  I won't complain about the skimpy size since it would have been a complete waste of ""food"".  The ""crab"" cakes came with a garnish of onion rings and a side of coleslaw.  The chipotle aioli tasted more like thousand island dressing.  On to the shrimp tacos.  Anyone who has had baja style shrimp tacos knows that they are breaded. In fairness to Sta Barbara Shellfish Co., the menu did not state they would be breaded.  According to my husband, they were just ""aw-right"".  From my vantage point across the table his plate did NOT look appetizing.  A side of box quality spanish rice to complement the tacos?!

I would give them a negative if I could. Pizza is 1 star quality. Really only good for late night when you're drunk, but hey that's one thing. It's another thing to have the rudest staff on state street. 

Fraternity Pizza: 
I waited 20 minutes, went up and asked if they called my number that I must have missed and they said no. They called 7 numbers ahead of mine at this point. Waited another 25 minutes, still no number called. When I went up again they said the ticket was 2 hours long and was accusing me of trying to get more. (Ticket said 12:56, it was 1:40am). I know my pic on here may say otherwise, but I'm no guy that's gonna slam 2 giant pieces of pizza and go up and try to get more, I'd go home and pass the fuck out. They were swamped so I get it, I've worked in the industry before. When asked if I could simply just get a refund or another order made they refused. I asked to speak with a manager (who apparently is also the cook). He told me he had a lot of people in line to worry about and proceeded to yell at me and how it was my fault. He also said I shouldn't have waited 2 hours to ask about it. Again I'm no mathematician, but it was now a full hour after arguing for 15 min trying to get things right. Him and 2 other people, one who was working the front and another cook proceeded to put their hands on me and tell me to leave. Note: I didn't raise my voice once or put my hands on anyone. Then I had drunk people butting in telling me it's only pizza, yada yada yada. Which it is, not that big of a deal, but it's simply the merit of making sure your customers get what they paid for. I felt like I was at a fraternity. 

Now I get it, it's known as a place for drunk people so I know they deal with some shit. But to simply push and yell at your customer out the door, because of your mistake will not keep you in business long. At least I hope not, Santa Barbara deserves better on State.

I went Saturday October the 17th 2015 I drove out to Santa Barbara which is about an hour drive from my house. I am Latino and I wear fitted jeans with a dress shirt every time I go out to a club. When I was at the door waiting to go in and it was my turn to show my I.D the guy checking the ID's who I found out his name is Carlos looks at me with a sarcastic face and says ""sorry but I can't let you in your pants are baggy"" I looked at him very surprised and at first I thought he was joking and I smiled then he replies ""what's so funny? You can't come in"" and tells me to leave. By this point I am enraged so I moved away from the line and I was paying attention to what people that were going in were wearing. Nothing against anyone I am not racist or have anything against anyone I just wanted to see what people that were going in were wearing and there's was a group of Caucasian guys and 2 of them were wearing baggy pants a lot baggier than the ones that I was wearing but for them he just checked their ID and nicely let them in! He noticed that I was standing there just watching what he was doing and I went back and asked him for his name, by this point he looked a bit nervous. I myself am a business owner and would never even imagine about treating somebody the way that this guy Carlos treated me. I would hope that no one went to this place because somebody like Carlos can ruin your night. I just went because I wanted to go to a nicer place and this guy just ruined my night!

SERVICE:
-Was good.



LOCATION:
-Ocean view, of course!



FOOD:
-CLAM CHOWDER: by far one of the worst clam chowder I've had in a while. If you're on a pier and offer clam chowder, you better make it good!! To be fair, I was at Old Fisherman's wharf the weekend before and then I had Pike's Place Chowder up in Seattle within the last year. Did not like the thick chowder texture. It was thick in the wrong way, where it was separating into chunks after 10 mins of eating. The clam taste was not infused very well into the soup either, it was 2 independent flavors from each other. The soup was herb-y flavored, more so than clam flavored.

-CRAB CAKES: the worst crab cake I've ever had! I usually love crab cakes, but this one BARELY tasted like crab. Probably because of all the spice they put into it. If anything it almost had a slight curry taste. For a SEAFOOD restaurant ON a pier, I was expecting nice fresh chunks of sweet crab meat!! NONE of that, the crab was really fine (almost like canned?? texture) and there was absolutely NO sweet crab here, just spice flavoring. I was better off feeding $14 to a seagull.

-FRESH CLAMS IN BROTH: this was the saving grace of the entire meal. The clams were sooo fresh, super sweet and great texture! The broth had a little too much white wine & not enough garlic for my taste. It was also on the salty side, but the clams! OMG, the clams!!! One of the clams was bad though (dead taste) but the rest were fresh.",2014-07-14 19:13:56,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4087147,-119.6850187,4.0,2404,1,"{'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'Alcohol': ""'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': True, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'Music': ""{u'dj': False, u'live': False, u'jukebox': False, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': False, u'no_music': False}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': True, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': False, u'dessert': False}"", 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': True, u'sunday': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Live/Raw Food, Restaurants, Seafood, Beer Bar, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Bars, Food, Nightlife","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-14:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",0,really sure place high rating maybe ordered wrong item item order huge disappointment c amon yelp service good location ocean view course food clam chowder far one worst clam chowder pier offer clam chowder better make good fair old fisherman wharf weekend pike place chowder seattle within last year like thick chowder texture thick wrong way separating chunk min eating clam taste infused well soup either independent flavor soup herby flavored clam flavored crab cake worst crab cake ever usually love crab cake one barely tasted like crab probably spice put anything almost slight curry taste seafood restaurant pier expecting nice fresh chunk sweet crab meat none crab really fine almost like canned texture absolutely sweet crab spice flavoring better feeding seagull fresh clam broth saving grace entire meal clam sooo fresh super sweet great texture broth little much white wine enough garlic taste also salty side clam omg clam one clam bad though dead taste rest fresh

The dance floor was pretty small compared to some of the usual clubs I hit up in So-Cal, and it was pretty packed around 11 PM. The bartender that mixed our drinks was pretty hot, so 1 star for that. I got a red-headed slut which was ""ok"" and my other friend ordered a Midori Sour which she said was pretty stiff. Nice.

So we hit up the dance floor with drinks in our hands, dance dance dance until I realize this place does not play any hip-hop music. The music was okay, pretty fun, but when I go clubbin, I enjoy dancing to hip-hop the most. The crowd was totally not diverse and not a lot of people were actually dancing. Another bummer.

An hour later, I felt a little sick so headed to their bathroom..which was ridiculously small and nasty. How can there be only 2 damn stalls in a club? Are you kidding me? For the women's bathroom? FOR REALZ?! There were about 6 girls ahead of me and we were all stuffed and crowded in a dingy little bathroom. Someone pissed all over the toilet seat on one of the stalls, so there was only 1 good stall left. Nasty.

I walked out to the outside patio to get some fresh air and there were a lot of people standing around, chatting and drinking. I stayed outside for 30 minutes, waited to see if the music would get any better-but sadly, it did not.

Besides the free parking we managed to score because of our good looks and the $5 cover charge, there wasn't anything else that was good about this place. I would not come here again to get my boogie on.

In a nutshell:
-1 star for the sucky music
-1 star for the tiny, nasty women's restroom
-1 star for no place to sit, drink and relax (reserved only)",2009-05-27 06:02:56,Tonic Nightclub,634 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4187058,-119.6976996,2.5,208,0,"{'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': True, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}"", 'AgesAllowed': ""u'21plus'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'very_loud'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'WiFi': ""'free'""}","Nightlife, Dance Clubs, Bars","{'Thursday': '20:0-2:0', 'Friday': '20:0-2:0', 'Saturday': '20:0-2:0'}",0,last saturday night girlfriend headed tonic shake booty dance floor pretty happy cover charge low cover cost unheard la sd dance floor pretty small compared usual club hit socal pretty packed around pm bartender mixed drink pretty hot star got redheaded slut ok friend ordered midori sour said pretty stiff nice hit dance floor drink hand dance dance dance realize place play hiphop music music okay pretty fun go clubbin enjoy dancing hiphop crowd totally diverse lot people actually dancing another bummer hour later felt little sick headed bathroom ridiculously small nasty damn stall club kidding woman bathroom realz girl ahead stuffed crowded dingy little bathroom someone pissed toilet seat one stall good stall left nasty walked outside patio get fresh air lot people standing around chatting drinking stayed outside minute waited see music would get betterbut sadly besides free parking managed score good look cover charge anything else good place would come get boogie nutshell star sucky music star tiny nasty woman restroom star place sit drink relax reserved

ac2zDI9BpZtCKlVfNCNMaQ,QliFgy1YkFPS2KHy5fv4nw,gebiRewfieSdtt17PTW6Zg,1,6,0,2,"Probably one of the WORST experiences I've had in a restaurant :( Let me just start off saying, the food is good! Nothing wrong with any of the food, the chefs are amazing and we all enjoyed our food. The problem was with the service....

We made a reservation for 9 at 7:15 and we ended up getting their around 6:45. We were told we needed to wait because there wasn't enough chefs, which is TOTALLY fine and understandable. Then the woman at the front seats a party of 2 and another party of 3. So I asked why they were able to sit down before our group (and by this time it was about 7-7:10) and she told me because they had a smaller group.... Okay well if we had a reservation wouldn't we be first to sit down? We didn't care if the chef wasn't ready we just wanted to sit down order drinks and have some appetizers. We were then seated and our server Ivan came over very promptly which was nice. After he got our first round of drinks this is where things went down hill. 

We ordered some sushi, simple sushi. Salmon, and shrimp. We ordered 2 rolls, a crunch roll and a shrimp tempura roll. He brought out yellowtail, tuna and 2 veggie rolls. I kindly said that the food wasn't ours and that wasn't what we ordered. He told me that it was and that I was wrong. So I asked to see the sushi paper because maybe I marked the wrong thing. And then he said he threw the paper away but he took the sushi away with a HUGE attitude and said he would go try and find the paper. Well our group could see him in the back area and he pulled the paper out of his apron and came over and said oh yeah I guess it was my fault I brought you guys the wrong stuff.... Okay that's what we tried explaining! The stuff finally comes out and tasted perfect! So then some of us ordered the teppan and we got our miso soup and then once that was done we got our salad. None of us had forks and I'm pretty sure maybe 1 out the 9 of us knew how to use chopsticks so I asked for forks and he said yeah no problem. Well we waited out 10 minutes until we saw him again and couldn't find any other servers to ask for their help so we ended up just eating with our fingers. We finally see Ivan and asked for forks again and he said, ""do you honestly need them right now? Your food isn't being cooked!"" EXCUSE ME! I was so furious that he would even come back with such attitude. All of the girls needed forks and so we told him, yes we need them now. I almost got up to go find them myself! Anyways, chef comes, food turned out good and no Ivan to be found for about 30 minutes. So 2 girls in our group asked for boxes, myself included, and it took him about 15 minutes to get them so I ended up eating the last bit of food I was going to take home. So when he brought my box I said, ""I'm sorry, I don't need the box anymore I finished what I was going to take home, but thank you!"" (very politely) He then came back with ""ok well maybe if I take your plate away you'll stop changing your mind"" WHAT IN THE HELL!!!! At this point I was done trying to be nice. After2 and half hours I was so glad to be leaving! Ivan was so rude to ALL of the girls in our group! I hope if we go back, which we probably won't, that Ivan will not be there. I always try and give people the benefit of the doubt and maybe he was having a bad day, but if your day is that bad, don't come into work and be mean and rude to your customers. I work with the public and believe me, it's hard to always please everyone.

We called 24 hours in advance and made a reservation for two for the tapan tables for the next evening at 7:30 PM. Upon arriving promptly at 7:30 we were first ignored for 5 to 10 minutes at the door before finally being escorted to our table, where we were seated with two other parties, two couples, one of which was clearly expecting a third person. After waiting for a waitress to arrive to take our order for over 20 minutes, a frowning teenager finally arrived and asked if we were all ready to order. The woman that belonged to the party of three that was still waiting for their third quickly responded that no, she was not ready to order because their third friend had not arrived and the waitress promptly put away her notepad and left the table. WHAT?! Apparently because this group of strangers was not ready to order, the rest of us had to wait to eat. After the third of their party finally arrived at approximately 8PM, half an hour after our reservation time, we were finally able to order. My friend and I chose to order both tapan and sushi, and when the waitress asked if we would like our sushi roll while we were waiting for the chef we said we would. We received no sushi in the next 25 minutes while waiting for the chef to arrive, but rather the roll arrived towards the end of our meal. Overall, the chef was very nice and the food was what I expected of any adequate tapan restaurant. After finishing our meal, we had to beg the waitress several times to finally deliver our check, at this point it was around 9:30PM, we had been at the restaurant for two hours, and were completely exhausted. When she finally delivered it, we were displeased to see that she had charged us full price for our sushi, despite the restaurant's advertisement for half-off sushi during the time we were there.

Then I see him walk over to the microwave oven, touch that with his bare hands, touch dirty menus with his bare hands, and then go back to my spicy tuna roll and continue to scoop it and pack it with his bare hands ! I couldn't eat it after it was served to me. Since I was starving ordered another roll and ate that, but BAD IDEA. I immediately became dizzy and nauseous. I drank lots of water and decided that maybe I could walk it off.

Last time we came here was a NIGHTMARE
- told to wait 30 mins for table
-50 mins later and multiple times checking in to see if we can get seated (empty tables everywhere)
We were seated by the manager
- told we had to wait for the other party of 2 to show up... another 20 mins...
1 hour 40 mins later... we order...
- we get our water 10 mins later and salad 20 mins later 2hours and 10 mins later....we get our food order taken....the CHEF DOES NOT SHOW UP FOR 50 minutes ------- at this point the other party literally leaves- the manager runs after them( as we catch a waiter to ask where our chef is?!?!)

They bring us deep fried crap as a sorry and fresh nice fish to the people who ran out......are you freaking kidding me? (Also we don't eat fried food)

The couple was much older... so wE believe they also judged us by age..

Our chef arrives and does not verify our orders, doesn't say hello or smile.... he seemed exhausted... 

My salmon hibachi was raw and gummy and gross!!!

Steak was good

The kicker!! They attempted to over charge us- when we had already paid!! Said we had to pay more!! I almost wanted to throw their fried tempura at them. TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Also we had at least 5 different people come to refill our waters EVERY 2 minutes!!! What is going on in this place?? Management is TERRIBLE!!!

(Brought our local friends here since they had changed from something's fishy- they were so traumatized- said will never be back!) 

The older couple sitting at our table were in a date (we were on a double date with our friends) I felt so bad for them as this older couple was clearly tourists!

I walked into the restaurant to first ask if my dog would be allowed on the outside patio, they told me no since she is not a service dog. That was ok with me I understood so we walked across the street to figure out where we should try next. While across the street we saw a large family and their small dog be allowed onto the very same patio we were turned away from. I walked back over and asked a different gentleman why we were turned away and this dog was allowed? He told me they said it was a service dog. ""Service dog?""  that dog was not a service dog, not in its wildest dreams. I asked the man to level with me since we both knew they had lied.
This poor excuse for a dog, not a service dog just poor excuse for a dog in general is making real service dogs be turned away because they choose to lie (SHAME ON YOU FAMILY.)
So long story short I was allowed to bring my dog to the patio after a lengthy Q & A and me promising my dog would not bark, fight, or be a nuisance. After sitting down the other ""dog"" cried and barked constantly while my dog was still and quite. The children at the same table were screaming and crying and making it not worth staying.

I ordered a burger medium, it came out MOOOing. I took the first bite and almost got sick. I told my waitress, she attempted to fix it. She was very polite, and understood. After that raw bite, I was nauseous and no longer had an appetite. I didn't want a replacement.  THEN a BAR MAID, I think her name was ALLY, felt it necessary to invite herself into our ordering fiasco and made matters 100 times worse. She insisted I took the burger, asked me 3-4 times if I wanted the new burger, bringing it to my table obsessively. (sounds like good customer service, but was quite the opposite)

The problem was, my waitress gave me the wrong burger, my burger came up right after that one. When this BAR MAID brought the correct burger out 2 minutes after I sent my burger back, there was absolutely no way I was going to eat that burger, having no idea that the ""live cow"" I bit a chunk out of was someone else's burger.  I could hear the BAR MAID at the food counter rambling on and on about the burger, my table, my son and was not only rude, but not fit for the service industry. My son left the restaurant and waited in the car for me and my friend to finish.  This employee had no idea of the situation, but inserted herself in our dining experience. If I could give a -3 stars I would.

Our drinks came out and the ice tea I ordered was cloudy and tasted old.  I asked the server to exchange the poor quality tea for an orange juice.  

The server said he would, but that I had to pay the price difference of $5.00.  Really?  Maybe I should have just asked for my $3.00 back out of your register.

I paid the $5.00 difference and waited for my meal.  The food was good, but small in quantity.

ETJP6LCQEtSUvD6f8aS1_A,OISxmywOAxnamO1Kw8Q1pw,GgcvRnt5_z3NEC0D6vNncQ,1,5,0,1,"HUGE disappointment!  I am from Seattle and came down to Santa Barbara for New Year's Eve.  My girlfriends and I wanted to have a nice meal to bring in 2010. I thought I did my research--read reviews, got a recommendation from a local, and thought the online menu looked good.

When I called to make a reservation I had a lovely conversation with the owner--another confirmation that I had made the right choice.  Well, I couldn't have been more wrong.

My girlfriends and I got dressed up, made our way to the restaurant, and the second we walked in, I knew it was a mistake.  It was too cold to sit outside (which was beautiful), and so we went into the brightly lit indoor part of the restaurant, surveyed the scene and realized that we were the youngest people there by at least 40 years (and we are in our 30s).  The ""Latin jazz"" band was little more than forgettable background music, which did absolutely nothing to help the vibe.  There was no vibe.  The restaurant lacked energy, the wait staff were professional, but not personable, and the food was incredibly disappointing.

We knew we would be paying a lot (total 100.00 each) for a price fixe New Year's Eve dinner--and I have no problem spending that if the food is amazing, and the experience is unforgettable. As soon as we sat down we started to be served, the wait staff, highly attentive, perhaps because all of the food was already prepared in the back, not many people were there, and they wished they didn't have to work on New Year's Eve.  It was too much.  We got our drinks (mediocre mojitos) and immediately were served our appetizers, which made it hard to enjoy our drinks.  We could not languish over any of our dishes, but perhaps this was better, because the food was absolutely terrible.

I can only speak to what I ordered--it was the New Year's Eve price fixe, and apparently there was a guest chef that night, but I couldn't eat the majority of it.  The empanadas were OK; the soup was fine; I had a salad that had some kind of tangy dressing that I couldn't bear to put in my mouth.  The main dish I ordered was fish and it was served in tin foil.  I understand if it was cooked this way, but to serve it on a plate, with sides on the outside of the tin foil, made no sense to me.  In the end, it didn't even matter because the fish had absolutely no taste.

We ended up leaving before the clock struck 12:00--none on us wanted to start 2010 in a place that was bland, vibe-less, and forgettable.  I understand that this night may have been different from other nights, but it literally left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not return there nor recommend it to others.",2010-01-09 23:21:55,Cafe Buenos Aires,1316 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.424829,-119.706032,3.5,56,0,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'full_bar'"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'casual': False}"", 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'HappyHour': 'True'}","Restaurants, Argentine","{'Monday': '11:30-20:30', 'Tuesday': '11:30-20:30', 'Wednesday': '11:30-22:0', 'Thursday': '11:30-21:0', 'Friday': '11:30-22:0', 'Saturday': '11:30-22:0', 'Sunday': '11:30-22:0'}",0,huge disappointment seattle came santa barbara new year eve girlfriend wanted nice meal bring thought research read review got recommendation local thought online menu looked good called make reservation lovely conversation owner another confirmation made right choice well could wrong girlfriend got dressed made way restaurant second walked knew mistake cold sit outside beautiful went brightly lit indoor part restaurant surveyed scene realized youngest people least year latin jazz band little forgettable background music absolutely nothing help vibe vibe restaurant lacked energy wait staff professional personable food incredibly disappointing knew would paying lot total price fixe new year eve dinner problem spending food amazing experience unforgettable soon sat started served wait staff highly attentive perhaps food already prepared back many people wished work new year eve much got drink mediocre mojitos immediately served appetizer made hard enjoy drink could languish dish perhaps better food absolutely terrible speak ordered new year eve price fixe apparently guest chef night could eat majority empanadas ok soup fine salad kind tangy dressing could bear put mouth main dish ordered fish served tin foil understand cooked way serve plate side outside tin foil made sense end even matter fish absolutely taste ended leaving clock struck none u wanted start place bland vibeless forgettable understand night may different night literally left bad taste mouth return recommend others

VqLhu8ZfWW-aaIjkOakFzA,fd3ghDSlCfyEndBVoy4vgA,IUgQmteI-mbt_qjL2ZENKA,2,4,0,1,"This review of Epiphany will better-prepare you for a meal to this decidedly average restaurant that does actually has some potential.

A friend and I were in Santa Barbara on business and found ourselves in need of dinner and chose Epiphany due to suggestions from friends. We made reservations for 6pm, arrived around 15 minutes early and were immediately seated. However, this was the last time the staff would be prompt. 
 
Epiphany has a cool/hip/lounge vibe, but it was nearly 15 minutes before we even received a menu and our server was NOT cool or hip.
 
Our waitress limped through her intro, which actually enabled us time to choose our starters, (we chose the Filet Mignon Carpaccio, the Fish Ceviche, and a special pumpkin soup), along with our entrees since we feared it would be a while before our server would return. We ordered a Cracked Pepper Filet Mignon, an order of the Braised Beef Short Rib, and the Grilled Lamb Rack for our entrees, all medium.
 
Approximately 30 minutes later we received our starters which was disappointing. This was around 6:30pm on a Thursday and the house was only 30% full, so the kitchen had no excuse for producing starters at such a slow velocity.
 
Now, had the presentation been better, one could understand the length of time that it took for the kitchen to deliver the first round of food, but the delivery and appearance of the dishes was sub par and the flavors, in sum, were average...at best. 
 
Then as we receive the starters I notice out of the corner of my eye the sous chef sniffing and coughing in to her hands prior to heading to the grill. The tattoo on this chick's neck gave me pause, but that's certainly not unusual to see in restaurants nowadays. However, seeing an inked sous chef cough and sneeze in to their hands for all the restaurant to see IS unusual & completely unacceptable.
 
Now, this is why food is cooked but if you're going to have an open kitchen, like Epiphany does, the manager or chef needs to advise staff that perception rules reality and if one of your staff is sick, they need to make the extra effort to excuse themselves from the public eye and expunge whatever their body is producing in privacy.
 
Now after nearly an hour of working on our starters (yes, an hour) we received our entrees. The first to arrive was the filet mignon coupled with the short ribs. The filet was nearly perfect: it was cooked medium rare instead of medium but the flavor trumped the lack of focus on the grill...it was tender and full of flavor...a winner. The short ribs were also very good as we exerted little effort to obtain the meat from the bone and the flavor was robust. 

Both dishes came with very small sides, that were actually very good. However, the portions were dwarfed by the size of the entree itself and IMHO they could stand to pump up the volume here, for presentation sake alone.
 
Now, at this point we're still fairly hungry as we've completed our first bottle of wine & are on the prowl for more substance to counter the effects of the alcohol.
 
So we decided to order another steak as we were impressed with it's flavor and bang for the buck (the same sized filet at Mastros would be $15-20 more with no side) along with the lamb that was already en route but not delivered due to the size of our table.
 
Another 30 minutes passed before the second round of entrees arrived and upon delivery we were met with extreme disappointment. The steak was ordered the same as before, medium, but arrived barely rare. It was completely inedible & should not have been served. This was due to the chef clearly trying to time the delivery with the lamb. The steak was immediately sent back after which we received an apology from the chef through the server who asked if there was anything we'd like, on the house, while a new steak was prepared. We declined and opted to order dessert at that time since the restaurant clearly wasn't on point this night.

The lamb, however, arrived in good form, but was very fatty and tough and lacked the sweet biological flavor that lamb has to offer as it was marinated in an UK sauce that detracted from its natural essence.

20 minutes later the new steak arrived and I must say, it was perfect. It deserved to be photographed as a textbook medium prepared filet mignon...it was top shelf. This clearly demonstrates that the chef wasn't focused that night and that perhaps they weren't that motivated due to the small crowd.

After we demolished the second steak we waited another 20-30 minutes for our desserts to arrive but were not disappointed. We ordered the special pumpkin cheesecake and a pumpkin crème brulee...both were delicious. 

We killed our desserts in short order & decided to settle up our $200 tab as at this point we had spent nearly 4 hours at Epiphany and were GTG.

BL: there's a lot of potential here, but they missed the mark on my visit due to their lack of hustle and focus.

We had been there a little over an hour and a half and paid $250 for drinks and dinner. I asked to speak to the manager and the owner (who apparently is new and doesn't care about repeat business) met me at the door (in sloppy jeans and a tee shirt) and informed me that there was fine print at the bottom of the menu that says they have a 90 minute policy for tables!  I pointed out that there were other open tables and he said that other people wanted our specific booth. He was belligerent and unapologetic and offered nothing to compensate us for a bad evening at his restaurant.

This is a classical ballet you do not need to bring vulgar break dance or other improper body movement in it to get cheap laughs from the audience.

I get it, it is a possibility for students to show their talents and play along side professionals. But ballet is definitely not about stomping on the floor louder than the music. Also the acoustic qualities of the theater seem to be subpar. You just don't get that classical music magic which the genius of Tchaikovsky has designed.

Pros: Our guide was great, very knowledgable and had lots of great facts to share. The  gear was great and kayaks themselves were well taken care of and easier to handle than others.  Was expecting just a simple Deli lunch, but was surprised to get salads, wraps, fresh fruit, chips and cookies that were all pretty good!  Kayaking under Stern's Pier was a unique perspective and fun. 

Cons: We felt that the tour wasn't really as advertised.  Website says the whole tour would go from 10-2.  In reality, we didn't start with instructions until about 10:15 and didn't get into the water until closer to 11. We weren't too worried about the delay once were told we'd be back between 2 and 3, however, we were back on the landing at 1:55, pretty disappointing. The ""secluded beach"" was actually the Leadbetter Beach, which is next to Santa Barbara Yacht Club...which is about 1/2 a mile from the Sea Landing.

It was surprisingly not busy and my husband decided to come here based on the burger reviews. They helped us out fairly quickly. I was surprised a bit by the prices, yet I naively figured that it must mean the food is made with extra care. My husband ordered a burger and I ordered the roasted chicken. The burger, based on my husband's review, was delicious. My chicken, on the other hand, was a disaster. At first glance the chicken looked huge, so seeing some burned sections didn't bother me as much, that was until I noticed that what wasn't burned was pure bone. The couple of bites I took of it ended up being extremely dry and had no other flavor except for burnt. I mainly ate the mashed potatoes, which was also a disappointment, and considered the $22+ we spent on my meal alone, as a lost. Maybe I was unfortunate and the chef simply got distracted, yet for their meal prices I expected so much more. In regards to the service, like I mentioned, we got greeted and seated quickly. The only negative thing I saw was that some of the employees who I think had just ended their shift were sitting in the bar talking with the staff that was still on the clock and they complaint throughout our entire meal about their work and other guests.

20 minutes later we were handed three slices, instead of two, i brought this to the cashiers attention and handed her my receipt and the extra slice, but they could not find their own copy of it! So i got charged for food i did not order and received no refund. Poor service. The next morning I did the math to confirm, 3.80 per slice with 5 toppings is 6.30.

Over the past nearly thirty years, we have brought out of town guests here, celebrated special family occasions, spent date nights. One of our kids had a summer job here.  

So maybe it was a bad night last night. But if it had been my first experience of the restaurant, it would also have been my last.
I took a friend for her birthday. The server was rude; no friendly greeting, just a rushed "" have you decided?"" And when we said we needed a minute, we were ignored until the next ""are you ready?"" My dinner came to the table incomplete and cold. Not just a little cold; stone cold, butter congealed cold. I told the young man who brought it to the table that it was incomplete and he left to get the missing parts. But we had to flag the waitress down to tell her it was cold. She just looked at me and said ""okay I'll bring you a side of..."" I told her to take the whole plate and bring the whole thing back hot. I was not even upset, just kind of shocked. 

After dinner the waitress brought a bowl of ice cream without asking if we wanted a dessert menu. My friend had been looking forward to Paradise Pie, a house specialty. We saw other people ordering it , so they were not out. And then walked away. We had to catch her to ask for coffee.

A little background... I have psoriasis, it's on my legs and hands and whenever I get a mani/pedi I try to explain to them that it's not contagious and that it doesn't hurt when they massage it, usually that's all I have to say. When I first sat down and rolled up my pants I tried explaining what it was, instead of saying okay and giving me my mani/pedi, there was one guy that went on and on about it. Asking me questions like ""do you see a doctor?"" and ""how long have you had it?"" and he also said ""you need to go see a different doctor because it will go away"" and ""you need to put oil on it"". I've had psoriasis for 10 freakin' years, I think I'd know what I needed to do! Now, I can't understand Chinese or Japanese or whatever the heck they're speaking but I can understand body language and it was obvious they were talking about me which bothered me even more. Finally the ""psoriasis talk"" subsided and the man went and worked on someone else. There was a new girl that came over to work on my hands and I had to explain it all over again, luckily she was a little nicer about it. After my nails and toes were finished I was waiting for my nails to dry and to my astonishment the employee sitting in front of me was PICKING HER NOSE!!!! I was appalled to say the least! And then my worst nightmare came true, when my nails were finished drying she came over, took my hand and rubbed alcohol over the top (I had gels done). I couldn't help but feel like I was going to throw up. I immediately got up and washed my hands and got out of there as quickly as possible.

The only good thing about dining here is we got a 90min free parking with validation and their clam chowder. Unfortunately, that's it. 

With all the good reviews, my expectations were high. It was a hot day and it was lunch time, we didn't mind the long wait under the sun. But the wait could have been shorter if the staff were more attentive. There were already vacant seats but it took another 5 mins before they call the next guest on the list. Not good for the business, definitely not good for waiting customers.

Crab cakes - If i didn't know what they were, I won't be able to guess that they were crab cakes. Just a fishy patty of some sort.

Fried calamari/scallop/shirmps - They were cooked just right. Could have been perfect if they were not salty.

Rock crab special, served with soup and salad - Soup and salad were served first, expecting they were cooking the crab. After 20 mins, we follow up on the crab and it was brought to our table right away... It was big! At least the top shell.. Underneath the deceiving shell was a crab half of the top shell size. The top shell was even clean, meaning it was empty like as if it has been washed and used several times already. Also, we waited 20 mins for a steamed crab to be served COLD.. Not just room temperature but like it came out of the fridge. Thinking we may have placed the order wrong, we asked the server if it was supposed to be cold. She acted surprised and took the crab back and said she will send it back to be reheated. She came back just few minutes after she sent back the crab, im not surprised that its still not warm. What a waste of money. 

Silverwares have heavy water stains, looks very unsanitary. Forks were crooked. We asked for water refill for all 5 glasses and she only filled 2 glasses and attended to needs of the other customers.

We chose this place because we wanted Indian and we liked the decor, even tho the prices were notably MUCH higher than any other Indian place I have been to.  But we wanted to sit on a little pillow on the ground and feel cool.

We were greeted by someone who took our drink orders and we were told our waiter would be right with us.  The waiter came 10 minutes later, and we still had no drinks.  We were interested in the vegetarian thali because it was 4 vegetarian entrees, an appetizer, rice and chuntley for $25.  So we asked the waiter what the 4 entrees were and he said the chef picks.  So we asked what the chef picked today and he said he didn't know and he couldn't ask, it would be ""a surprise""  OK, for $25 I don't want a surprise.  So we insist he goes in the back and ask.  We also asked if we could please have our drinks and repeated our order.  He started walking back with the chef, but the chef only walked about half-way to us before he abruptly turned and went back in the kitchen.  The waiter then told us he knows 3 of the 4 things we are getting, and the appetizer is also unknown.  So we all just say whatever and order it, along with a $15 bowl of some sort of paneer entree.  And then he asked us what we wanted to drink, so we ordered those for a third time.

The food arrived almost immediately... before our drinks even!  Our Thali was 3 mini-sized vegetarian entrees (which I am used to getting super small potions for a thali, but for $25?  Really?!) rice, naan, and some sort of rice pudding.  There was no appetizer.  The paneer had only 4 pieces of cheese and was a VERY small portion, about the same amount you get in those $1 pre-made Indian Food pouches.  The tea was AWFUL.  We asked the waiter what happened to the 4th entree and the appetizer, and he was confused.  He went back to the chef, came back out and told us that rice was the 4th entree and the appetizer is the rice pudding thing.  At this point we threw in the towel on this place.  We paid for the paneer, but they wanted us to pay for the tea which we only had received minutes prior.  We should have paid nothing.

We ended up going across the street to All India Cafe where I received a vegetarian Thali for $14 that was FAR superior.",2011-08-03 02:10:20,India House,418 State St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4165402,-119.6945773,2.0,136,0,"{'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'True', 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'HasTV': 'True', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'Ambience': ""{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': True, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}""}","Home & Garden, Home Decor, Restaurants, Shopping, Indian","{'Monday': '11:30-21:0', 'Tuesday': '11:30-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:30-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:30-21:0', 'Friday': '11:30-21:0', 'Saturday': '11:30-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:30-21:0'}",0,went party female total far worst dining ever story chose place wanted indian liked decor even tho price notably much higher indian place wanted sit little pillow ground feel cool greeted someone took drink order told waiter would right u waiter came minute later still drink interested vegetarian thali vegetarian entree appetizer rice chuntley asked waiter entree said chef pick asked chef picked today said know could ask would surprise ok want surprise insist go back ask also asked could please drink repeated order started walking back chef chef walked halfway u abruptly turned went back kitchen waiter told u know thing getting appetizer also unknown say whatever order along bowl sort paneer entree asked u wanted drink ordered third time food arrived almost immediately drink even thali minisized vegetarian entree used getting super small potion thali really rice naan sort rice pudding appetizer paneer piece cheese small portion amount get premade indian food pouch tea awful asked waiter happened th entree appetizer confused went back chef came back told u rice th entree appetizer rice pudding thing point threw towel place paid paneer wanted u pay tea received minute prior paid nothing ended going across street india cafe received vegetarian thali far superior

There was, but it was two room suite and cost a considerable amount more.  I was offered the room at the increased price, but declined.  I asked to not be charged, or refunded if I already was.  The front desk representative named Andy told me he couldn't do that.  I asked to talk to a manager.  He stated the manager wasn't on site.  I asked if we could call the manager.  He said he did not have the manager's number and couldn't call.  He was extremely rude!  I continued to request to we call the manager or give me a number I could call.  I explained that if he wasn't empowered to resolve the issue that maybe his manager was and we could work things out.

I called them and they said there's a $100 cleaning fee if you have a pet because they don't allow pets.  I said there was nothing to clean, and he didn't disturb anyone.

I had dinner here on a Tuesday by myself. I was seated quickly at the sushi bar. I ordered 1 specialty roll and 2 standard rolls. The Mexican roll was excellent. Really, really good! The other 2 were not, and I only ate 1 piece of each. My tempura roll has no tempura, but the real problem was the seaweed wrappers were so strong and overbearing I could not enjoy the flavor of the fish.  I later realized there was a board of specials and wishes I had ordered off of it. They had some rolls that sounded wonderful.

A bigger issue for me was the service. I was never given water. I was asked to move to make soave for a larger group (this is fine, happy to do it) and while I didn't mind at all, I was never given a dish for my soy sauce in my new seat. I ended up using the serving tray. These are minor inconveniences but could have been resolved if someone had checked in even once to see what I needed.

Rude Manager, unwilling to work with guests.

We checked into our room during that heat wave (mid-May).  The upstairs unit we had reserved was over 100 degrees inside the room.  There was no air conditioner and the heat was unbearable, especially since it was upstairs, sun beating in, and no ventilation.
The girl at the front was very nice and tried her best to cool off our room with old fans, but it didn't really help.
I found a room across the street at the Best Western for $40.00 less and it had air.  When I approached the girl at the front regarding the possibility of us moving, she said she didn't think the manager would let us out of our reservation.  We had only been in the room for 20-30 minutes max.
I was surprised by her reaction to letting us leave, since the room was really not suitable for anyone.    
So I asked her to please call the manager and said that I would talk to him personally.    She called and he told her that he would not talk to me, but if we left he would charge my card for the night's rent. ($210.00).  WHAT?!?!
We stayed because I could not afford to pay for both rooms, but what a horrible experience.  I felt like we were being held hostage.   We were all unable to sleep in the HOT room!  We had all the windows open which made it very noisy.  And some of the screens were ripped, which let in bugs.  It was really awful.
I spoke to the manager the next morning when he came to work and told him how disappointed I was that he would not let us leave.  Not only did he not apologize but  he was rude, flippant,  and condescending.  He just kept repeating, ""You want me to lose the revenue from your room?""  Really?  
I tried to explain to him that he was not seeing the bigger picture.  The $210.00 he was so worried about losing was nothing compared to the loss of future revenue from us, friends and family members that used to frequent their motel.

There was a line at the door, and everyone in line was murmuring whether or not there was a host/hostess, sign-in sheet, or if it was a ""seat yourself"" situation, until the hostess finally presented herself after 10 minutes of waiting.  The hostess was an older woman - nothing special about her; she was wearing a plain long-sleeved white shirt and pants that looked like the equivalent of grey yoga/workout pants.  The reason I mention this is because it was like she was judging those waiting in line by their appearance, and helping only those whom she thought deserving of help, while she wasn't exactly your ideal looking hostess.  She seated a party of 3 at the bar, then 2 very obviously drunk girls who got in front of us at an outside table that still had dishes on it from previous customers, took one look at me and my mom, then not-at-all-discreetly asked the couple behind us if she could get them something to drink while they waited.

With that said, the $65 price for a couple of crabs, some melted butter, six onion rings, some romaine lettuce, croutons, dressing and a cup of bland chowder was not worth it.

I gave this place two stars because one was the effort of being greeted as my boyfriend & I walked in. Kudos. 

But when I started talking about what I wanted and where I wanted my tattoo, I instantly got a ""oh hell no"" vibe.  She basically said no can do and went on how its not gonna fit and blah blah blah but seriously tho, I have seen a similar tattoo like the one I wanted, done on a finger and it was pretty clean. She kept looking at the picture and winged the price from anywhere from 120 to 150. (which I was kinda okay paying for because differences places varies. So, i was gonna get it done.) 

Anyways, so I told her that I would give it more thought to another placement for my tattoo because she obviously didn't like the originally placement idea. I was already skeptical about Golden Eagle, after 10 minutes of deciding, I came up with another placement and told her about it. from the 10 minute pow wow with my boyfriend deciding on placement to her doing her own thing, She looks at the picture a couple more times & talks about the size and measuring the size with her fingers ... and all of a sudden, She blurts out 180. (The fuck? Are you serious?) I was okay with her winging the price the first time but now, She was talking outta her ass. 

I honestly don't know what happened. She gave me the same size of how big I was gonna have it and priced it fair and she came back & sized it the again the same but gave me a ridiculous price. After hearing the 180, we said our goodbyes and am never going back.

But then as the night progressed the DJ played purely hip hop. Okay, so I'm not hating on DJs that like to mix hip hop with their EDM songs because if done right, it can sound great. But this DJ was NOT doing the music right.

Anyway, I could swear that people were trying to do the dirty on the dance floor. I was standing in the middle of the floor just trying to enjoy a good time and I couldn't even stay long because everybody around me looked like they could use some quality alone time in their own hotel room. Gross.

 I am a local, born and raised, and have come here many times. I had friends visiting from out of town and wanted to show them around the funk zone. We stopped in to grab a glass of wine, and two of us decided to use the restroom. Apparently there is a sign on the door that says only person can use the restroom at a time. However, I did not see the sign, which was an honest mistake on my part. My friend and I went into the bathroom together. Less than 30 seconds after going into the restroom, we heard a loud banging on the door. This happened three times during the 2-3 minutes max we were in the restroom. I hadn't even had a chance to wash my hands yet when my friend opened the door to see who was banging on the door, and this very drunk girl comes running in, screaming at us. She proceeded to pull down her pants in front of us and started peeing. I have never seen anything like it. She accused of us of taking too long and causing her to pee on the floor. When we walked outside, we saw a puddle of her pee on the floor. Then an employee came up to us and told us that we shouldn't have been in there together, and we said sorry we didn't know. 

We then went back to grab our glasses of wine that we had ordered and tried to find a place to sit. As I was walking through the doorway, a girl bumped into me. It was the girl who peed on the floor. She then called me a racist name and walked outside. We ignored her and decided to stay and let it go. One of my other friends went up to order another glass of wine, and they refused to serve her, telling us that we had been ""kicked out."" When we asked her why, she said it was because there were two of us in the bathroom. Then, a second employee with a British accent came walking over, and said in an EXTREMELY RUDE manner, ""You guys were kicked out a long time ago, I don't know what you are still doing here."" I tried to explain to her that we had no idea we were kicked out, but she wouldn't listen.

Eventually, someone (maybe the manager) else came over, and told us that we had to go because ""we caused a girl to pee on their floor"" because we were in the bathroom too long. We tried to tell them that we were only in the bathroom for a couple of minutes. We weren't even in there long enough for me to wash my hands because this girl was being so disruptive and rude. However, it made no difference. They didn't even give us a chance to explain our side of the story. Meanwhile, they let a racist drunk girl stay even though she was the one who peed on their floor.

And finally, to top it off, when we walked outside, that same girl was out on the sidewalk drinking the wine from this establishment, which is illegal. 

Now normally I would never write a bad review. In fact, I have never written one before. However, this was the rudest treatment of any establishment that I have ever seen. It was especially frustrating because I was showing my friends around my town, and to be treated this way was unacceptable.

My tattoo was quite simple - Picasso's line drawing of his friend's dachshund on my shoulder. It's a symbol representing my service dog who happens to be a dachshund.

This place had some great yelp reviews and we loved the idea of wine tasting with beautiful ocean views so we decided to visit.  
The views from Deep Sea are absolutely gorgeous.  The deck lets you look out over the ocean as well as back to the shore so you see the beach, the city, and then the hills in the distance.  The inside of the tasting room is clean, well-presented, with some nautical themed displays and a long bar where you can get your tastings.  
There are three tasting menus available, a flight of whites, a flight of reds, and a mixed flight.  I had the white flight, my boyfriend had the red (and then we shared sips).  I'm not a huge fan of red wine most of the time but I actually quite liked several of their red wines.  My favorite wine here was the Halcyon Reisling.  It was light, sweet, and crisp.  We bought a bottle to have outside on the deck.
I also have wonderful things to say about the staff here.  While I had no idea what sort of planning had gone into this trip, my boyfriend had been corresponding with the staff at the Deep Sea Tasting Room for a little over a week to make sure we had a reserved table outside and a few other details had been worked out so that he could propose to me :)  It was a lovely location, and a perfect proposal, and at least some of it was possible due to the kindness of the staff here.  My now-fiance and I are incredibly grateful for their efforts and are already planning on visiting next year.
Overall, I'd recommend this place to anyone.

It's not a huge place but has a good sized bar area along with a long and high community table as the main seating options. There is also a really nice outdoor patio that's away from the road. Lama keeps an eclectic mix of about 20 beers on tap at any given time spanning the gamut from light sours thru big chewy stouts. These days 20 beers is a solid number but not amazing. What is amazing about the 20 beers they had on when we visited was the quality level of the producers represented. A few great local brewers you don't see a lot around town, Draughtsmen and The Brewhouse as well as some fairly rare sightings from outside the area like Bottle Logic , El Segundo and 21st Amendment. Sour beer lovers take note, spots 11-13 on the board are reserved for sour beers.. Overall this is a great place. Staff are great, vibe is really good, it can get packed but on a not too crowded day it's a place you just never want to leave.

We all enjoyed our hairstyles, although mine ended up falling out by the reception, which was something I wish we had anticipated (I had a very simple low bun which ended up unraveling).  Everyone else's hair held up fine, I think it's just my unruly hair!  My bridesmaids actually decided to get their makeup done there last minute (I did not) and one of them recently told me she never likes the way people do her makeup but she loves the way it turned out for her looking at pictures!

The black cod was so perfectly cooked and flavorful; the sashimi was cut so we could immediately see how fresh it was; the unagi wasn't covered in a super sweet ""unagi sauce"" but instead was served in a flavorful, slightly sweet broth; the house-made mochi crepe with red bean paste and cherry blossom leaf was one of the most simply, delicately satisfying and balanced desserts I've ever had. Nothing here to distract customers of their strive for simple elegance. 
The waitresses were friendly, knowledgable, and professional. They recommended how to eat certain items and explained the dessert should be taken with green tea. Small suggestions like that made my girlfriend and I feel very comfortable.

A friend and I, while visiting California, were in search for the best burrito in Santa Barbara. Yelp and almost an hour of walking past several nicely decorated though slightly touristy looking Mexican sit down restaurants led us here.

We had low expectation when we walked into this restaurant, and I mouthed ""I'm sorry"" to my friend for leading her past a bunch of really trendy looking restaurants to this hole in the wall. ""We walked all the way for this, let's just eat"" she said. We ordered two beef burritos and I poured salsa into those tiny paper cups. 

Burritos were served and after the first bite my friend said ""this is the best burrito I've ever had"", or at least that's what I think she said, because I was too busy stuffing my face with the best burrito I had ever had. People have claimed to have seen god in a grilled cheese sandwich, or a potato chip, but I found one in a delicious beef burrito from Cuernavaca.

Easy to find (tallest building in Santa Barbara) with convenient parking in a lot across the street (SW) and a parking garage behind (NE) the Granada is home to the Santa Barbara Symphony, Opera Santa Barbara, one of the venues for UCSB Arts & Lectures and features Broadway touring productions through Theater League.

We've enjoyed season tickets the Broadway series since the re-opening and enjoy the productions for the most part but more importantly, the facilities. There's barely a bad seat in the house but beware of the boxes. Sure you look cook in your perch but speaker risers often block some of your view. Beverages are available on both floors including wine and snacks. At least for our shows, you can take your drink to your seat. 

On a long show, your butt may fall asleep but starting with row J and moving back, every other row offers more space between you and your friend with personal arm rests. The alternating rows share one. It does get warm so dress appropriately. That goes for temperature as well as venue. Show some respect and don't wear Crocks and socks to a play. No really. It does not look good. That's not to say you can be casual. It's the beach baby and everyone is laid back. I see jeans and Polos next to suits and sports coats. It's not the big city so you can cut back a bit on the attire.

The main bathrooms are on the second floor but the first floors are rarely used. Yes, it says handicapped on the door but that indicates it's accessible. There is one stall and 2 stand ups on the men's. The judge suggest I stop going into the women's so I can't comment there.

This place is small and located at the end of the pier, parking can be a problem sometimes, but I guess you can valet it up front or wait it out. When you walk in you cant help but notice the variety of sizes of fresh crabs and lobsters in the large aquarium tanks to your left with a guy behind the glass counter chopping and steaming them. I always order the spider crab special which starts off with a cup of clam chowder; absolutely the best Ive had thus far. They also serve a few shrimp dishes along with different lobster dishes as well, apparently lobster is available about 6 of my 10 visits.

1. You are literally 2 blocks away from the beach, walking to local wine bars in the area is 10 minutes, walking to downtown State St. is roughly 10-15 minutes, and the best local bar in town is a 5 minute walk down the street.

2. Had two double queen rooms for 8 guests and it was plenty roomy. They even got us an air bed in one because we had 3 couples and two singles. The air bed was even a nicer aerobed!

3. Free beach cruiser rental! We rode to downtown the morning after to get some coffee at The Press.

4. They have a simple breakfast for you included in the price. The standard OJ, fruit, and then a bagel with lox, tomato, and lettuce. It's sufficient to keep you held over until 11a or noon.

Having traveled to many different destinations, and always trying new things, it was a bit of a search for me to find a new adventure for us to celebrate what we came up with as ""Awesome Dad Day."" 

I had tried several searches of ""things to do"" in Southern California when I came across Santa Barbara Adventure Company's site. I never knew there were sea caves to kayak around in the Channel Islands - so when I saw this as an option, it was my first pick. 

The office Manager, Mallory, was incredibly helpful and friendly when I called with my questions and to make the reservation. She offered ample information and got us excited about our new adventure. When we arrived at Ventura Harbour, we met our guide, Brina. She proved to be both knowledgable and experienced in not only the kayaking part of journey, but also the birds and wildlife that surrounded us. Once we arrived at Santa Cruz Island, she kept things very fun and casual. We felt no pressure to get suited up or paddle anywhere in a hurry. We felt confident she would only have us do what us first-timers could handle, but she always offered both easy or challenging options. 

Next time I'm looking for something different and fun to do, my first check with be with Santa Barbara Adventure Company to see what else they might offer.

After horseback riding in Goleta, we decided to walk on historic State street...which I have to admit is amazingly charming. Small town feel with historic buildings..... yet tons of shops and very cute.

They had tons of organic fruits and veggies, cheese, a pie lady and tons of flowers. 

I ended up getting some of my favorite flowers, daffodils! Lovely! Since our local Calabasas farmer's market never has daffodils...and since it was my birthday, it made it all the better.

Our group of six walked over from the Funk Zone Patio after grabbing some light bites. There is someone who cards you at the entrance, and you immediately get a sense of how open and airy the space is. It's large--like Costco warehouse spacious with high ceilings and an open setup. The beer bar is right at the epicenter, and a smaller back bar serves wine. There's also a open air market in the back part of the space that is filled with trinkets and merchandise that local vendors sell. It's cute if you're looking to browse and walk around to clear space in your stomach for more drinks and food.

I enjoyed a pint of the Weekender Session IPA, which was refreshing and totally a session IPA. The hops were just perfect, and the body was flavorful and fresh! The flight options are wonderful, and if you love it so much...they have growlers too.

We were standing the whole time since it was packed on a Saturday late afternoon. There were so many people of different ages, but it is a more mature crowd...which makes it more relaxing and chill. I loved that they have the indoor and airy space, but a long and narrow outdoor area for those looking to avoid the warehouse noise.

My gf and I like SB Seafood Co. because the food is fresh, the atmosphere is awesome, views of the harbor are excellent, and the service is friendly.

Seating inside and outside are a bit scarce, but if you are lucky enough to get one of the 4 outdoor tables, you will have an amazing view of the harbor and pier. 

Daily specials vary. 

We went big for dinner last time ordering Maine lobster and Alaskan king crab.

This time around for lunch we tried to order light. 

We started with the lobster bisque and a couple of oyster shooters.

The bisque was pretty amazing. The shooters were on par w/ Brophy's which were very tasty.

For the main event I ordered maine lobster roll. Pretty bomb...loaded w/ lobster meat I split it with my gf. It came with onion rings and cole slaw. 

My gf ordered the fried oysters, calamari, shrimp, and scallops. Pretty delicious. The calamari were a little over cooked and chewy though. The rest were well executed.

The Eagle Inn was worth every penny! yummy free breakfast everyday, free bike rentals, free movie check out to enjoy in  your room! we stayed in a king jacuzzi room and it was a beautiful!  2 person shower, and a private little patio with seating at the corner of the building. We loved taking the bikes out since there was a beach trail 2 blocks from the hotel! Since we were their to get married, they treated us to a free romance package! Everyone was kind and courteous and is a great place to enjoy some quality time with a loved one!  The only note I have to anybody staying here is that there is nobody on staff after 10 p.m. (and unfortunately there are 2 advertisements on premises claiming their is security) and they lock the main entrance to the hotel....which you need your room key to get in and out of. We stepped outside to grab something out of car just after  10 p.m. in our pj's and got LOCKED OUT of not only the hotel, but also our room on our wedding night!!! it took 45 minutes to have an off property security guard come to let us in the hotel and our room....and since our key didnt work anymore and there was nobody to make us a new one, we had to wait until morning ( and not leave our room again) to get a new one. It was so unfortunate that this happened, - even more so on our wedding night. It really put a sour taste in our mouth since they advertise there is someone on site at night and there isnt...thats just not okay to do.

I chaired a huge carnival and reached out to them about serving shave ice at our event.  From the moment I reached out, they bent over backwards to not only make it happen, but make it happen smoothly.  They were so easy to work with, even in the months leading up to the event.  And I absolutely loved the fact that when I told them we require all vendors to only serve with compostable and recyclable items, they said they already do!  And no corn syrup or artificial colors, and only natural fruits and real sugar in their product?  Yes, please! And now let's talk about the event itself.

The ParadICE booth was the most popular stand at our event, and for good reason.  As soon as they started setting up their area, I knew they were different in their attention to detail.  Everything was immaculately clean and fresh looking and professional.  Their booth just drew everyone in, for all five hours of our event! There was a huge line all day... and not because they were slow, but because everyone wanted to get their hands on this delicious treat.  

One more thing... I am NOT a ""sno-cone"" person.  At all.  And I've had shave ice before (even in Hawaii) and can honestly take it or leave it.  But not this.  I got a few bites of someone's toward the end of the event and I didn't want to stop.  Truly one of the most delicious and refreshing treats I've ever had.

Once we viewed the property we knew that it was our reception venue. The staff is very knowledgeable and helpful - every time we came for a meeting they offered us complimentary beverages including champagne and beer. When we were doing our walk through a few days before the wedding, Eli, the catering manager made some really great recommendations for improvements in design (table locations) and flow and we were very glad to utilize his expertise. The day of our wedding it was incredibly hot - luckily they have a/c - but Breanna came by multiple times to check on us to see if we were cool and comfortable. Because we purchased one of the wedding packages with a buffet style dinner, we weren't able to taste our menu a head of time.

So when my weekend plans got cancelled at the very last minute and I heard that we were going to Santa Barbara instead I got understandably excited! Oh, the mission! *Squeal*! What I wasn't aware of, though, was the fact that Santa Barbara has a presidio! Being from San Diego, Im well aware of presidios and missions. We have the first ones in California. But unlike San Diego, Santa Barbara actually has a presidio. It may be fake and reconstructed, but its there, and right in downtown SB nonetheless! It was the first established settlement in the town. Since this is the case, the actual area of the presidio is stretched over 4 blocks. like right in the middle of an intersection. 

Whats really cool about this place is that they have reconstructed rooms and signs that tell you of the uses. It may be small, but you can actually see what the presidio was used for. They even have gardens with vegetables and crops growing! It was really cool stopping by after lunch and doing a quick tour of history. No one was there so it felt like I had the whole place to myself. I didnt go into the church area because there was a wedding going on, but it looked interesting from the outside.

When I finally got to visit the venue I was blown away by how beautiful it is, while also having a very comfortable, homey vibe. The pictures on their website are very accurate. It is an old, historic building though, and it does show a bit of age in certain spots.
During the wedding planning process we worked with Breanna to understand the packages, pricing, food options, etc. She was super patient and helpful. Both of us are pescetarians and they were super flexible about our preference to not serve meat. We really appreciated that! 
We did a pre-wedding walk-through with Breanna and the catering manager, Eli (and our wedding coordinator, Shauna from Alegria by Design) and they were very thorough and accommodating. They were even willing to move furniture to make our wedding vision come to life! 
On the day of the wedding it was absolutely magical to get ready in their beautiful bridal suite! We spent all day doing hair and make-up in that lovely room- sitting on the lovely white couch I felt like I was character in a Jane Austen novel! And it makes for super pretty pictures :) The air conditioning in that room did experience a glitch that day, but luckily we didn't get too terribly warm and were able to access other air conditioned rooms to cool down when needed. 
Our guests also loved the Riviera Mansion! Not only is it a beautiful and very comfortable venue, but the staff were incredible! They took great care of everyone, always making sure that people had exactly what they needed. Multiple guests commented on how fantastic the staff were! We were absolutely thrilled with our wedding day at the Mansion. It's such a unique and memorable location. I loved seeing our guests exploring and enjoying all of the different spaces throughout the event.

However, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.

The special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  

The salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. 

But enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. 

We were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip.

First, when I walked up and saw the open air cafe I was blown away by how cool this placed look and was stoked to see there was a line b/c that generally means that you are in store for a treat when locals take the time to wait for fare.  

Then after waiting in line for a while it occurred to me that maybe the line was due to the comically slow service.  I waited about 10 minutes in a line of about 6 people before putting my order in.  I considered a few times going somewhere else, but decided I should wait it out.

Finally, I had arrived and was able to place my order.  I got an Ethiopian blend coffee and their extra thick sourdough toast with almond butter.  Both were totally worth the wait.  The coffee was a perfect complement to the wonderfully sour toast.

We researched and interviewed many photographers before deciding on them and we were so happy we did!  Michael and Anna's style and attitude really put us at ease on our wedding day and was one of the aspects we loved most about working with them.  They gave great direction when they needed to and for the most part let us and our wedding party just be ourselves as they worked.  One of my big concerns with the photographers was that they were going to be noticeably taking photos of everyone all night and people would feel uncomfortable.  Not the case with Michael and Anna!

The atmosphere is very casual and family-friendly and parking is easy and can be validated.  My main disappointment with this place is that although all the fish and seafood was definitely fresh, the majority of it was flown in from other locales (mostly Atlantic Ocean).  It just seemed so silly to eat seafood flown in while sitting next to the ocean.  I had the crab sandwich (not local crab) and it was really delicious.  My husband had the lobster (from Maine) tacos and was disappointed.  I tasted it as well and found that they weren't terrible but all the seasoning and additions really took away from the great taste of lobster.

Local SB wine taster here.

I just dropped in for a beer and to check the place out to see if it's ""Worthy"" and I do believe it is.  

A Great Place to try new wines, sample the best of the best, and compare different regions...

What I like:
 - Many different wine flights

 - Beer tasting

 - Different regions represented: In other words, you can put a SB County pinot up against one from Sonoma County... truly a great way to taste the  ""terroir"" of various regions

What I wish was different (why I withold a star)

- A tad loud.  It wasn't packed on a Tuesday eve, but was pretty loud.  Could use some more softness in the room to quiet the echo.

- Beer flights is Ok but lacking... If you offer a ""Chardonnay Flight"" of 5 Chards, or a ""Pinot Noir Flight"" of 5 Pinots - why not a ""Porter Flight"" of 5 porters or an ""IPA Flight"" of 5 IPAs etc.. (I understand fridge space and logistics would be a challenge for this - but I'm just sayin' - beer deserves equal respect!

- Good luck getting the fireplace seats... people park it there and won't move for ages

- Laminate bar.  Ok, I'm a snob on this - but either wood, stone or concrete.  I don't expect to see laminate.

- Tasting room hours... generally close at 6 but this is a SB Zoning issue.  But I'd like them to stay open longer

At the end of the day - Corks & Crowns is worth a visit.  Because they're an independent tasting room; they have the liberty to pick great wines versus just showcasing one label.  If I had a tasting room, I'd want it to be like this; but just with a nicer surface on the bar.",2011-03-22 23:04:19,Corks n' Crowns,32 Anacapa St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4142112,-119.6887567,4.0,276,1,"{'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'HappyHour': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""'average'"", 'GoodForKids': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'Alcohol': ""u'beer_and_wine'"", 'WiFi': ""'no'"", 'Music': ""{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': False, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"", 'DogsAllowed': 'True', 'GoodForDancing': 'False', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""u'casual'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'HasTV': 'True', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': True, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': True, 'saturday': True}""}","Wine Bars, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Nightlife, Bars, Arts & Entertainment, Wineries, Food","{'Monday': '11:0-20:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-20:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-20:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-20:0', 'Friday': '11:0-20:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-20:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-20:0'}",1,spot santa barbara urban wine trail cork crown refreshing welcome addition mix local sb wine taster dropped beer check place see worthy believe great place try new wine sample best best compare different region like many different wine flight beer tasting different region represented word put sb county pinot one sonoma county truly great way taste terroir various region wish different withold star tad loud packed tuesday eve pretty loud could use softness room quiet echo beer flight ok lacking offer chardonnay flight chard pinot noir flight pinot porter flight porter ipa flight ipas etc understand fridge space logistics would challenge sayin beer deserves equal respect good luck getting fireplace seat people park move age laminate bar ok snob either wood stone concrete expect see laminate tasting room hour generally close sb zoning issue would like stay open longer end day cork crown worth visit independent tasting room liberty pick great wine versus showcasing one label tasting room would want like nicer surface bar

We arrived at 4:00 and check in was super easy. Everyone was very friendly and we were all set for our 3 day vacation.

So we were a bit stressed out, but trying to enjoy our time. The hotel has a great location and sitting on the balcony looking out at the beach was so peaceful. It's pretty quite and the rooms are standard, but very inviting. Parking is tight, but there is plenty of street parking.

Throughout the day we kept getting calls that his health was deteriorating and he had, had a stroke and needed emergency surgery. So at 11:00 pm we went to the lobby with all our bags and said we needed to check out and drive all the way back to Orange County. There was 0 questioning or lack of empathy. Johnathan (who was there all day) was so understanding and helpful. He pointed us in all the right directions of what we needed to do to cancel our stay, and was so positive it really helped to lift us up in this time. They refunded our stay which was amazing because the hotel isn't cheap.

The establishment is small, with about 4 tables outside and a few inside with the beach view. And of course there are counter seats facing the open kitchen (best view in my eyes). We were famished by the time we got there so we took the first available seating which was at the counter. We saw how the seafood was hand picked (literally) and prepared.  

Service was very attentive as our orders was taken right away. Food came out fast and the hotel that we stayed at (Milo Hotel) gave us a complimentary clam chowder order for this place, it was definitely put to good use. The clam chowder came in a cup, not in the bread bowl. It was more than enough as an appetizer and tasted so good. For our entrees, we had the Rock Crab Special and the Calamari Sandwich. Both orders came with a side of cole slaw and union rings. I am a big seafood lover so getting my hands dirty for that delicious crab was so well worth it. The crab was a little smaller than expected but super fresh and delicious. The Calamari Sandwich was also good, the seafood quality here is unbelievable for the price.

My friend had been to the Shellfish Company before on a previous trip and couldn't stop raving about the fresh seafood at this hole-in-the-wall place on the pier.

We left our hotel and trekked all the way down to the end of Stearn's Wharf, once we arrived we wrote our names on the clipboard (read: hostess) outside and waited.  We got lucky (as far as I could tell afterward, very lucky) because we were seated within 20 minutes.  Once I entered the place I realized how lucky we were since the entire restaurant seats about 30 people!

We debated for awhile between the 3lb. Rock Crab that was on special for $24 and the Alaskan King crab.  We ended up going with the Rock crab on the advice of our waitress and we split it.  Along with that we each got a soup with our meal.  In addition, we ordered the fried shrimp and calamari appetizer.  The soup was good- being from the east coast and traveling to Boston I have pretty high standards for my clam chowder, and this stuff was good, but nothing to write home about.  The appetizer was great and the fried shrimp was unusually impressive- they were large and had a nice batter on them.  Finally, the crab came and we went to town.  It was undeniably fresh and was definitely enough for two people given the soup and appetizer.

Shellfish Company is a great idea for out of towners to get their hands on some fresh catch.  However, you have to be cognizant of the tight seating arrangements (either at the bar or along a counter) as well as the long wait that's associated with having such little capacity.  It will however, give you great food and a hometown, local feel.

This time around instead of a trip to the Channel Islands we stayed coastal and kayaked the shoreline around Refugio State Park. The thing that makes Santa Barbara Adventure a world class touring firm is their employees who are very passionate about what they do. Our guide Brendon was a very likable gentleman from the get-go. His attention to detail be it the history and geography of the coastline to the safety of his participants was impeccable. He put out a wonderful food spread halfway through the trip that gave us time to explore the tidal pools and wonderful stretch of central California shoreline where we beached and a little time to swim and relax before heading back.

There are hands on exhibits highlighting science, art and technology with similar exhibits as other museums in Northern CA, such as the Exploratorium in SF and tech museum in San Jose but in a smaller, less in depth scale. There's a nice rooftop play area (which is really sunny) with water play and musical instrument displays, as well as, view of the Santa Ynez mountains on one side and Pacific Ocean on the other side.  There is a short, 15-20 minute movie in the theater on the second floor which runs about every 30 min (schedule is posted there). We arrived at the opening time and the kids, 5 and 8 years old, played for about 2 hours. We may have been able to stretch it out for another hour but not the whole day. 

I did find myself wishing there were plaques with blurbs explaining the science behind some of the less self explanatory exhibits. There are several guides walking around offering help but they are not always there. For example, the Mind Ball exhibit. Two guides walking around gave variable responses about what was actually being measured (one talked about alpha waves and another just said a blank mind is better). Another example, the drum on the roof. It appears that you complete the circuit with your hands with the drum beat corresponding to your heart rate. 

I would recommend a hat for the roof as it is very sunny there, as well as, snacks (no cafe or snack bar). Check out the movie schedule on the second floor at or near the beginning of your visit if think you want to watch. We tried to go towards the end of our visit and didn't know where it was located, then got there when the auditorium was full. We left without watching the movie because we didn't want to wait.

We parked our car and haven't gotten back into it. Everything is walking distance. From state street to the peer and everything between. We had late lunch in downtown and walked to beach for sunset, although the sun sets behind the mountains, the changing colors in sky are beautiful. 
Breakfast was YUMMM  and everything was perfect. The Santa Barbara casita was clean, charming, spacious and the bed super comfy. Private entrances and we haven't seen another guest. Lil parking lot is full so we know there's others here.

My wife and I have been vacationing or visiting our kids at college in Santa Barbara since 1987. These two days at the Eagle Inn have been without  a doubt the best stay since our days at the Miramar. We've stayed at almost every hotel you could imagine in SB, so this means a lot! 
The staff were so friendly, they made us feel like family. From the front desk person to the house keeping staff, we were so impressed with their hospitality. The hotel was clean and neat, so was our room. 
The complimentary breakfast was awesome. The fresh fruit to the egg dishes, to juice and coffee, fresh pastries, and assorted breads were all fantastic.

I got a small serving of the Hawaiian bread French toast and the prisoner egg. 

The French toast came soggy, because they already add the syrup. If you're calling in, definitely ask for it on the side. I can only imagine how much more delicious it would be if it weren't bogged down with syrup. 

I had high hopes for the prisoner egg dish. 
The muffin is nice if not a bit dry. The egg was overcooked. But I still really liked the idea of it and I would order again just to see if it could taste any different.

Affordable doesn't mean cheap and dirty with Castillo Inn. Our room was clean and decorated nicely. The beds were comfortable and our room even had two tv's. The only thing that bothered me a little was that the cleaning staff did not re-stock toilet paper and towels, which meant we had to re-use towels and at one point had to use tissue paper since we ran out of TP. We tried calling the front desk but it was late at night so there was no answer. Check out was the following day so we just let things be.They should have been more on top of things than this. Other than that, everything else was fine. 

Our room was on the 2nd floor. The booking, checking in, checking out process was easy. The location is perfect. 1/2 a block from the ocean and within walking distance to their trolley stop and the marina. You can take the water taxi from the marina to take you to the pier for restaurants, ocean, beaches, pier, night life, shopping, landmarks, etc etc. The trolleys are inexpensive and great way to get around. We had so much fun exploring Santa Barbara. It felt like time went by too quick but it was a memorable trip and we will definitely stay at the Castillo Inn if we come back to Santa Barbara.",2014-07-15 18:34:01,Castillo Inn at the Beach,22 Castillo St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4088277,-119.6946257,4.5,233,1,"{'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'}","Hotels & Travel, Event Planning & Services, Hotels","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '0:0-0:0', 'Wednesday': '0:0-0:0', 'Thursday': '0:0-0:0', 'Friday': '0:0-0:0', 'Saturday': '0:0-0:0', 'Sunday': '0:0-0:0'}",1,girlfriend decided go santa barbara weekend looked affordable nice place stay affordable mean cheap dirty castillo inn room clean decorated nicely bed comfortable room even two tv thing bothered little cleaning staff restock toilet paper towel meant reuse towel one point use tissue paper since ran tp tried calling front desk late night answer check following day let thing bethey top thing everything else fine room nd floor booking checking checking process easy location perfect block ocean within walking distance trolley stop marina take water taxi marina take pier restaurant ocean beach pier night life shopping landmark etc etc trolley inexpensive great way get around much fun exploring santa barbara felt like time went quick memorable trip definitely stay castillo inn come back santa barbara
UkyFfi6_4_VHrFOk_F3BRg,biiytB_o3KzSq_s2WlDkOw,SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,5,7,3,8,"My favorite place to get shellfish (besides fresh off the pier on Saturday mornings). It is not just a tourist trap, even though you can find it at the end of the SB pier past all the other tourists traps. Love to get the rock crab deal ($25 for a 2-3lb rock crab with onion rings) 

My favorite moment:

I will never forget the day we tried their California King crab for the first time. It was a weekend when all my girls came back to town and we had gone kayaking/ S.U.P. (With paddle sports from the Harbor area) and we had made plans to grab an early dinner from the shellfish co. While on the water we saw them pulling up fresh cali kings from the side of the pier. After our hour on the ocean, we were famished but still aware that it could be a wait since the place is small and popular. Luckily since it was early (before 5pm dinner rush) we were seated quickly. The server recommended the cali kings, said we wouldnt regret it because they were really fresh. We looked over and there they were! Being dumped into the tanks. They were kicking and trying to climb out. 

Priced at $17.95 per lb, they came anywhere between 1.5 to 3 lbs. I went for a 2pounder. That first succulent bite was heaven. And I mean, damn that is one buttery heaven. Each morsel was so large, so sweet..all of my girls and I were silent, with glistening eyeballs staring at each other. 

After that day, I couldn't get that crab out of my mind. Any chance I could I wanted to go back before the season was over.

But be careful, a 3 pounder means you're eating a $75 crab. Only negative is that you can only choose between soup or salad. For that price..I should've gotten both. It's okay, just add a $1 and you can both i guess. 

Besides the crab, the oysters are always good and I highly recommend the uni appetizer. 

Okay I really recommend the uni appetizer. I usually buy my own uni fresh and shuck it at home, but these they place on top of a fresh scallop on top of a lime pinwheel with a side of ponzu. It's so fresh and clean, that they leave the empty uni shell as a center piece with its spines still wiggling.",2017-04-20 04:19:46,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4087147,-119.6850187,4.0,2404,1,"{'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'Alcohol': ""'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': True, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'Music': ""{u'dj': False, u'live': False, u'jukebox': False, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': False, u'no_music': False}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': True, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': False, u'dessert': False}"", 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': True, u'sunday': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Live/Raw Food, Restaurants, Seafood, Beer Bar, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Bars, Food, Nightlife","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-14:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",1,favorite place get shellfish besides fresh pier saturday morning tourist trap even though find end sb pier past tourist trap love get rock crab deal lb rock crab onion ring favorite moment never forget day tried california king crab first time weekend girl came back town gone kayaking sup paddle sport harbor area made plan grab early dinner shellfish co water saw pulling fresh cali king side pier hour ocean famished still aware could wait since place small popular luckily since early pm dinner rush seated quickly server recommended cali king said wouldnt regret really fresh looked dumped tank kicking trying climb priced per lb came anywhere lb went pounder first succulent bite heaven mean damn one buttery heaven morsel large sweet girl silent glistening eyeball staring day could get crab mind chance could wanted go back season careful pounder mean eating crab negative choose soup salad price gotten okay add guess besides crab oyster always good highly recommend uni appetizer okay really recommend uni appetizer usually buy uni fresh shuck home place top fresh scallop top lime pinwheel side ponzu fresh clean leave empty uni shell center piece spine still wiggling

One of which was Deep Sea Tasting Room. It's located on the pier on the upper floor of one of the buildings which provides a really nice view from the pier. I didn't catch the stores on the first floor but I believe they were souvenirs-esque... or not but anyway they were on the left side as you walked onto the pier.
We walked around the building, on up the stairs and straight up to the bar. Well that's pretty much the natural flow of this spot which is nice because you can get started on the tastings without delay. There's a patio/deck you can sit at to enjoy the view while you also enjoy your selections. We sampled a couple flights and we were enlightened on the regions the wine came from along with a brief background on ""wine-ology"". Not so much the scientific aspect but more so snippets of history on the travel of how the wine ended up in our glasses. There were a couple very delicious Pinot Noirs that I enjoyed.
Afterward, we took our new found enlightenment to a couple of the other nearby wineries as recommended by the folks at Deep Sea which turned out to add to a really great experience.

The decor is very clean and contemporary and the ambiance is just as friendly as always. 

I'd like to reinforce that last point. In nearly four years of frequent visits to both locations of the French Press, I've never once experienced nor seen any customer be treated with condescension by any of the staff... even when the customer might very well have been acting like an entitled wanky jerk themselves. 

In fact, I can't recall any café or restaurant with friendlier or more polite staff than the French Press. Because I've neither seen nor experienced any evidence to support such claims, and because I've spent quite a lot of time at the French Press over the years, I'm left being forced to assume reviews claiming otherwise must come from jealous competitors or people with warped perceptions of reality...?

My husband and I live in Philadelphia and we decided to get married in Santa Barbara not only because of his family but also because it's one of the most romantic and beautiful cities in the US we've ever been to. There were so many good places for weddings in SB, but we chose the Riviera Mansion (University Club) not only because of its old spanish charm and elegance, but also because of their good wedding packages. I was close to booking another venue, but my heart was telling me to look for one more place. The day I spoke to Breanna about the mansion, I was sold immediately. I booked the venue right away. She was very pleasant to talk to, and she was very patient in answering all my questions. We communicated via email and phone for almost a year before the wedding, and she was very consistent and accommodating! I sent her numerous emails about my plans and inquiries, and her turnaround response time was very quick. When we flew to SB for our initial meeting, she was very sweet and friendly, and gave us a tour of the mansion. We fell in love with the place all over again. Before visiting, I relied on the photos in the website and on Facebook, but after seeing the place in person, it was much better, and I felt so happy that I followed my gut. And until our final meeting before the wedding, Breanna went through the wedding timeline thoroughly to make sure that everything was in place, and even came on the day of the wedding to check if everything was all set.

Despite my sensitive/problematic ears (my 1st lobe piercings from a mall kiosk are still wonky 12 years later), my Golden Eagle piercings have all healed beautifully and look great, and even the cartilage piercings were practically painless. I'm actually planning another cartilage project at the moment... 

Both Johnny and Josh are absolute professionals who do excellent work and take a lot of pride in it. Whenever I describe the type of piercing I wanted, they examine the architecture of my ear (to make sure it would heal well and look good) before agreeing to do the piercing.They always double check placement before actually doing the piercing to make sure it's exactly what I want. They do a great job of explaining aftercare requirements, and they always encourage me to come back to the shop if I have any questions or concerns about how a piercing is healing. The shop is immaculately clean and well maintained, and both Josh and Johnny are meticulous about sterility (they don't let customers touch any of their piercings, healed or new). The guys are really friendly, and even a mild needle-phobe like myself can easily feel comfortable throughout the piercing process. 

The jewelry selection is beautiful and extensive, and they often have sales or special deals. The shop is cash only, but there is an ATM downstairs so it's not really a problem.

We cycled over the uneven wooden surface of Stearns Warf pier (bottles of recently purchased white clinking together in the front of my basket) to find this little gem of a restaurant perch at the farthest corner of the pier. 

I wanted to try everything on the menu but my body failed me. I worked hard to try as much as I could though. (Will have to condition my body for the next time I visit). 

I started with the urchin over scallop and served on top of a slice of lime. Drizzled soy sauce over, was delicious. (That is on their specials board.) Went on to eat a crab sandwich which was also very tasty, with huge crispy onion rings. 
A few crab claws later a foodie smile appeared. 
I then helped finish off my wife's Cioppino dish, which was equally divine. Served in a  hollowed out loaf of bread, the juices get absorbed into the bread and it is yum for the tum.

Fresh local produce. 
Our server was so helpful, bright and enthusiastic. 

Tips
It can be windy at the end of the pier and if you sit outside it maybe a good idea to put an extra layer on.
It is possible you will be queuing up to be seated (it is very popular) be patient, it won't take long and the food is so worth it. Maybe call up to find out how busy they are before.
Be prepared they may have run out of certain things. It is in fact a good sign everything is fresh.

There is the option of sitting at the tables outside, but the wait is usually a little longer for that. 

We ordered the Clam Chowder and the Shrimp Tacos. The chowder was good, but a little to creamy for personal taste. The shrimp in the tacos were cooked really well and the creamy salsa was delicious and added a lot of flavor.

fmiR4zDiVKZzDZdX6MqxjA,v_Hu9cbMPOPWO83VxVPrRA,SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,4,0,0,0,"Discovered the Santa Barbara Shellfish company by accident. I saw that the wait was abnormally long, even for a Saturday night. Visually, it's a dive and very casual restaurant. Decided to go for Sunday late lunch after 1:30 p.m. on Sunday instead.
There are no real tables unless you sit outside, you sit on a counter where they do most of the cooking or a ledge by the window. Outside has patio seating.

 My boyfriend and I started with the oyster shooters and the fried scallop and fried oyster plate. Loved both. They use Japanese Panko crumbs instead of batter which is a big plus. Then we decided to splurge and share the Full size lobster! Absolutely delish! Grilled Lobster to be exact... succulent and cooked to perfection and worth every penny! ($39). It's served with a large cup of bisque (lobster or chowder), we had the scrumptious lobster bisque, and also served with a creamy pineapple coleslaw and a few onion rings. 

I had a great experience with the service. I guess we just got lucky. The place gets pretty hectic and people get impatient so they tend to be rude, which then makes the staff defensive. Can't blame them. Always be nice to restaurant staff and they'll be nice to you! Simple...

Long story short... the food is great. Great portions. A little pricey, but hey... it's friggen beautiful Santa Barbara, it's expected. Worth it.... BUT, still cheaper than Moby Dick Sea Food which is next door... horrible, no flavor, over cooked food and more expensive!!! I digress.....

Only gave 4 stars because the place is a bit visually dirty inside and out. They definitely need to ""clean"" the place up a bit. I like rustic charm and all but not splattered lobster and crab juice on walls and windows. Also, Can barely see out of the windows because they're so dirty, which was a shame since I was facing the ocean and it would have been a glorious view. 

Anyway.... please give this place a try! Food is great. But be patient, you will have to wait. Bring a snack if need be.

Based on Yelp reviews, I originally wanted to try a Mexican place on Milpas. There were a few places but no parking, police activity, and mostly tourists.  Yes, that's what I said.  In my experience, being from l.a., whenever tourists are involved, quality goes down, especially in family run Mexican food!  I don't go near the chains!

Anyway, after being bothered about the parking and avoiding the crowds of State St., I stumbled upon Taqueria Cuernavaca.  Tacos al pastor are my fave so getting 3 was a no brainer.   Yum yum yum!   A squirt of lime, some onion and cilantro.  Delicioso!  Not greasy at all and love the pineapple on top!   The salsa selection was decent. The two green salsas seemed too spicy, and the pico de gallo seemed to have no spice, besides tomato.  Oh well.  I'm here for a few more days, I might hit this place up again.  Highly recommend it and will return!!!

Anyways, you guys probably aren't interested in that. Although if you are, don't be, you have no idea how draining it gets after a while. Anyways...

Parking and walking through the front doors you immediately get this feeling of awe. The front doors look to be almost a hundred feet tall! You feel like you are walking into this important place, which you are. 

Getting to walk around, especially in the main courtyard, was just very cool. It's green, photogenic and overall, enjoyable. The first thing that you might notice is that there are so many people here all doing different things. While I was there, people were taking wedding pictures, being tourists, I was there with hundreds of other high schoolers all dressed up for our mock trial tournaments, there was even a couple of Disney princess there. Everyone comes here. 

If you are fortunate enough to be able to go into a court house like I was, that's where the trip becomes even more magical. I won't give too much away, but it is unlike any other court I have ever seen. They have banners, high ceilings, all the good stuff. It gives the place a sense of majesty, like you are walking into a royal conference or something.

Make sure to make it up to the view and climb the stairs  (resist the urge to take the elevator) to watch  the clock/bell at work. The view, although not super high, is breathtaking and gives you a good look at the beauty of Santa Barbara.

We saw high schoolers doing some sort of club activity here (maybe MUN?) but that didn't stop us from enjoying the courthouse. You are free to walk he grounds--no intrusive security guards or large tour groups. It didn't feel so touristy/museum-y either which for some reason made me appreciate the experience all the more.

My mom had never been here so it was perfect.  A few months before the trip I knew I just had to reserve a room at Castillo Inn because last time we were very happy with the room, amenities and location. 

This time you were on point Castillo Inn! I reserved the same room as last time because it was very roomy and pretty. There were four of us. The tp and towels were stocked nicely and we didn't run out of either. The wifi was free and fast. The morning breakfast treats were great. My mom loved having her coffee, pastries and fruit.

They have a lot of flights at very reasonable prices which range $8-20. They feature a lot of small and unknown wineries and it is pretty cool to get a small taste of the California Central Coast. 

I got the Pinot Noir flight and my husband tried the Gold flight and unlike other reviewers, I feel that the value here is pretty good, considering you get to try many quality wines and the pours are generous. I also noticed that they offer free corkage at many local restaurants if you buy wine from them and that buying from this wine bar means you are getting a discount of up to 20% on the wine.

The only downside for me was the cheese plate. For $18, I expected a bit more choice and quality. The pre-packaged Whole Foods cheese and charcuterie plate just wasn't my thing.

You can apply the flight price to your wine/beer purchase, which is always a plus.  

The flights are pretty affordable (normal for the area), with a range of options for different prices (i.e., chardonnay/white tastings are cheaper than some cab/red tastings).  

This is the best place to take a group, even if they are newbies to the wine/beer tasting world.  The location is great - take a walk along the coast after you taste!

The crunchy roll was one of the best I've ever had. Beyond the food itself, the service was pretty good. Our waitress failed to notice us for awhile, and in return brought out two plates of edamame on the house to apologize. From there on it was great service. The presentation of the food was incredible. They cook your food right in front of you and even give you a show along with fairly large portion sizes that coincide with the expensive pricing of the hibachi meals. If you go here, the price greatly depends on what you order. If you go for hibachi it will be expensive, and if you go for sushi it will be a cheap comparatively to other sushi restaurants.

The tacos were great and the portions I feel we're good value for the price and the extra condiments were free (salsa, onions, radish, cilantro, limes).

There are probably 2 Mexican eateries for every person living down here. While you can find a burrito on every block, that doesn't mean they're all created equal. Having eaten my weight in carne asada burritos over the years, I've compiled a wish list for what I look for in a good burrito:

1) It doesn't leak; nothing's worse than picking up your loved one only to have them drip all over your pants.
2) The tortilla doesn't fall apart, come undone, or otherwise misbehave in any inappropriate matter.
3) The meat (beef/ pork/ chicken, etc) is GRILLED. Not boiled. Not pan-fried. Not heated by a magnifying glass channeling the sun. 

We stopped here on a whim after driving back from Avila Beach. I ordered a shrimp burrito and my wife had the 2 taco plate. The burrito was delicious and may go down as the best I've had in recent years. Not only did it meet my requirements, but it exceeded them. It was ""just right"" in size, i.e. not humongous and leaving you in a food coma. Also, it was cut in half, making it much easier to eat and put salsa on. As you eat. The tacos were also great and well-proportioned. Service was friendly and fast. Place was clean. Get in here.

You walk in and a big bar, tables and seating off to your left as well as a dance floor. The floor is very small compared to how big this place is, however a bit better since the reconstruction. 

So you go off toward the back and there is another small room with more seating, a round couch, and a bar. This is nice, easier to talk to ppl in the back. Then to the outside.

The patio is massive than the majority of the bars in SB. They have cabanas that are nice to have bottle service, they have another bar that gets very packed! Ppl are out here for fresh air, talk to ppl and to smoke. Typical. They also have heated lamps. O and make sure you go ou the correct door, b/c it gets so crowded that the bouncers get mad sometimes.

Music: it has anything from hip hop, mash ups, techno, trance etc etc. 

Drinks: ehh not too bad. Again, a bit pricer b/c this is a more club-like atmosphere, not your laid back bar scene. They had great adios (AMF), washington apple shots, ummm anything with tonic water LOL... etc etc. Choose your poison.

Crowd: I would definitely say more uptight crowd, the beautiful ppl, LOL those who like the LA night scene, well you get the idea. Honestly, I go here to drink anyway so the scene I don't care about that much. :D

I stopped going to this place b/c most of the bars I liked were closer to the other side and I didnt' like to walk all the way down blocks and blocks. HAHAH call me lazy, it's ok.

It's not a 5-star hotel, but it's quaint, charming, and fancy enough to let you know your money was well spent.

Quite by chance, we chose the perfect time to dine here, and as a result we witnessed during the course of our meal both the sunset and the moonrise, followed shortly after by a light fog swallowing the coastline. With the sound of the incoming waves slapping against the pilings beneath us, it was the ideal setting for what was a flawless meal. It was late in the day and, having skipped lunch in favor of extensive sightseeing, we were ravenous, so we started with a bowl of creamy and delicately seasoned lobster bisque and a richly dense New England style clam chowder. We followed this by sharing a pound of steamed mussels, served in a white wine and garlic broth, every last drop of which was absorbed by crusty French Bread, and then splitting an order of calamari, sauteed in butter, garlic, white wine, and sun-dried tomatoes and served on a bed of linguini. Including tax and tip, we stuffed ourselves for only $17.00 each! The very nautical decor and bustling open-air kitchen add to your dining enjoyment.

Breakfast Culture Club serves my favorite espresso in Santa Barbara. In fact, it's some of the best espresso I've ever had (better than even the best I've found in LA/SF). It has a fruited sweetness to it, a hint of red fruit, perfect mouthfeel, and insane sweetness. Their beans are from Coava, which I'd never had until coming here, and the espresso blend is just brilliant. I think they used to use coffee from Handlebar, which also makes good espresso, but I'm very glad they switched because Coava makes a much more interesting espresso (Handlebar is good, but very typical--roasty toasty notes, caramelly, but definitely not fruity).

I like to get a Gibraltar, a Cappuccino, or just straight espresso. The Gibraltar and Cappuccino both bring out the strawberry notes of the espresso, and end up very sweet because the espresso is just great here. The texture they achieve on their milk is fantastic as well--exactly what I want in a Cappuccino. That said, if I want something with more punch I just go straight for the espresso.

Their toasts are also very good. I think they've changed how they do toasts since previous reviewers posted--they prepare the toast for you, so it actually is instagram ready if you're into that :)

As for ambiance, this place is perfect. The opened garage door makes the whole place feel very open and spacious. Strong hipster and surfer vibes around, you'll often see people barefoot. Also usually a couple people working on their laptops. There's about 4 or 5 power outlets available. Usually I've been able to get a spot with an outlet if I need it, but in the morning it can be so busy that it's hard to find a free table with an outlet.

Highly recommend stopping in here if you like fruitier espresso drinks.",2018-08-16 07:03:58,Breakfast Culture Club,711 Chapala St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4177795287,-119.6998998701,4.0,108,0,"{'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'Caters': 'False', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"", 'RestaurantsTableService': 'False', 'Alcohol': ""u'none'"", 'BikeParking': 'True', 'WheelchairAccessible': 'True', 'DogsAllowed': 'True', 'GoodForMeal': ""{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'HasTV': 'False', 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': True, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}"", 'OutdoorSeating': 'True'}","Nightlife, Coffee & Tea, Art Galleries, Bagels, Bakeries, Coffee Roasteries, Shopping, Coffeeshops, Food, Cafes, Restaurants, Arts & Entertainment","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '7:0-17:0', 'Wednesday': '7:0-17:0', 'Thursday': '7:0-17:0', 'Friday': '7:0-17:0', 'Saturday': '7:0-17:0', 'Sunday': '7:0-17:0'}",1,made account write review breakfast culture club serf favorite espresso santa barbara fact best espresso ever better even best found lasf fruited sweetness hint red fruit perfect mouthfeel insane sweetness bean coava would never coming espresso blend brilliant think used use coffee handlebar also make good espresso glad switched coava make much interesting espresso handlebar good typical roasty toasty note caramelly definitely fruity like get gibraltar cappuccino straight espresso gibraltar cappuccino bring strawberry note espresso end sweet espresso great texture achieve milk fantastic well exactly want cappuccino said want something punch go straight espresso toast also good think changed toast since previous reviewer posted prepare toast actually instagram ready ambiance place perfect opened garage door make whole place feel open spacious strong hipster surfer vibe around often see people barefoot also usually couple people working laptop power outlet available usually able get spot outlet need morning busy hard find free table outlet highly recommend stopping like fruitier espresso drink

We arrived and realized that our room didn't have the tub that we requested at check in, but the front desk employee quickly changed our room and put us in the back building (which was actually better for us - considering the kiddo - a bit more isolated) and apologized for the confusion.  

We enjoyed our private patio feature and he large bathroom.  I also appreciated the amenities provided in our room.  Make-up remover was a nice thing to have provided in the room (though they stopped replacing it half way through our stay) and we also enjoyed the option of being able to bike places (as the hotel provided bike rentals).

This spot is located on the pier. We had a little difficulty navigating to it because there weren't any signs directing us to this place. It's located on the second floor of one of the buildings to the right. Google Maps had pointed us to another building further down the pier.

I'm not a huge wine buff, since I just recently started to enjoy wine, so I can't really speak to the wines. But we checked in on Yelp to get the yelp deal - I think it was a free tasting of the chardonnay, and also opted for one of their tasting menus. It was $20 for the both of us and 5 wines.

It's a cute little place and the view is amazing. It was a little cold when we went but not too bad considering it was January and we were wine tasting right on the ocean.

OYrtEEEu0qLiTdwlPm9egQ,LcqNuhqaYt5ekKzaRirmIg,SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,5,2,0,1,"I love trying fresh seafood on piers, wharfs and seaside markets. Most of the time, it is a disappointing experience but this place is not. The food is legitimately fresh and prepared well. The gorgeous view is just a cherry on top of nature's beautiful sundae. I have been here before but ordered the ""wrong"" thing (cioppino). That wasn't very good when I had it a couple of years ago here. 

We came for a late lunch/early dinner on a Monday. Even at 4pm,  there was a wait! We waited about 25 minutes and got a table outdoor. While it wasn't ideal that we sat right in the sun with no shelter other than our sunscreen and sunglasses, the view was worth it. 

We got the local crab special which was a steamed 3-lb. crab served with a salad and soup for $26. I thought this was quite the steal because the crab was huge, delicious and meaty. The garden salad was fresh as simple as it was. The lobster bisque we got was pretty good. (The other options were Caesar salad and clam chowder). They topped off the crab with a couple of onion rings and cups of cocktail sauce and drawn butter. Yum!

We also got the fried platter of shrimp, oysters, calamari and scallops for $12.95. It came with cole slaw, onion rings, tartar sauce and cocktail sauce. As greasy of a meal as this made, it was one of the better fried platters I've had anywhere. The seafood was just really fresh including the sometimes-feared fried oyster. :)

The ice in our iced teas melted away in the sun. Our waitress was so cool and brought us lots of extra ice and an extra iced tea in case we needed it (we did because it was hot out!). She was just friendly and good at her job - five stars for her!

By the time we left at about 6, there were so many people waiting. Make sure you sign up for a seat on the clipboard right when you get there. The restaurant is the last one at the very end of the pier. Parking on the pier is free for 90 minutes but it looks like a drive that will upset tires. I parked in the large lot south of the pier and walked 15 minutes up and onto the pier.

She would give me a brazilian wax about every 3 weeks. Wendy is absolutely amazing at everything that she does but recently has focused her talents more on skin care, primarily facials and things such as brow/lash tinting. She recommended that I try her fellow esthetician Alyssa and now I am hooked. Not only do we have the same name, which is pretty awesome but she is youthful, full of energy, super friendly and really knows what she is doing. Where before it has taken almost 25 minutes to do a Brazilian on me, it only takes Alyssa 10 minutes. That being said, I am Italian, pretty hairy and my hair grows out in several different directions near my bikini line, making it extremely hard to pull hair out without hurting me. Now, I have been to several other waxers before who claim to do ""speed waxing"" which ended being the worst nightmare you could imagine, leaving me bruised and uncomfortable for several days. She is the first waxer that I have had that pays attention to your hair growth patterns and pulls the strip accordingly, not just all the same way. Alyssa also specializes in waxing when their is only little growth. I referred my terrified friend who had not been waxed in years to try her out a month ago. She only had a week of growth since shaving and was doubtful that Alyssa could remove any hair, being that it was so short. She did just that and my friend was really impressed.

The prices vary from 5-maybe 20 something. They have this necklace, well unless they got rid of it, but its long and has grapes at the bottom. They come in different colors, very cute!

Amenities include a yoga room, CrossFit room, pilates room, aqua massage chairs, steam room, sauna, personal spa (in ladies room anyway- not sure about the mens)! 3 weight rooms (one outside over looking their pool & Los Padres mountains), Spin studio (out doors/4th floor) Earth bar (smoothies juices etc.) POOL, Jacuzzi, and to top it off... BEER AND WINE! HOORAY!

Their classes include multiple levels of yoga, Tai chi, boxing, spin, barre, (actually there are too many to count, just check their website) but my FAVORITES are lunch time lift & hip hop with Tamarr. So sooo fun. All of their teachers are incredible at what they do!

My other half is a yogi, as in yogi yogi we have a yoga room at our house. He is not a fan of gyms but after I got him to come as my guest (after 6 months) he loved it and joined the next day. Their yoga teachers are top notch, above core power which is THE SAME PRICE as the club. He also loves to swim laps, so the pool was an added bonus. 

The club is a bit pricier than most but for a reason. It is extremely clean and has amenities beyond what you could ask for.

1. Close to train station and just a short walk to the beach and State St.
2. It's quiet. Even though it only took us ten minutes to walk here from the Amtrak station, you could only hear the trains at night way off in the distance. Castillo St. is a slightly busy street, but our room (#17) was set back from the street, so we didn't notice traffic noise at night. 
3. Clean, clean, clean. There was no ""ew"" feeling when you walked in the door. I'm a bit of a germaphobe and this place passed my picky expectations. 
4. Modern and new feeling. The fixtures, granite counters and granite shower (with good water pressure), bed, and flat screen TV were all new...or at least they seemed like it. 
5. The staff were friendly. They seemed like the kind of folks you'd meet in a quaint, small-town sort of a place. Check in and check out were super fast. They let us keep our excess baggage there on the last day while we wandered Santa Barbara a little more before our train left.

I judge seafood restaurants by their clam chowder. I was not disappointed. Except... there was a hair in my soup. Which was a little gross, but the clam chowder was really good. Server was experienced and knowledgeable about the menu and seafood in general. 

Uni with scallop was soooo good. Very fresh and buttery. 

Clam pasta was perfectly al dente, but just a tad bland. 

Lobster was heavenly. It was cut in half and grilled just right. Came with 2 onion rings and some coleslaw on the side.

The Shellfish Company is a good name for this restaurant as there is all kind of yummy seafood.  I opted for the Maine Lobster tacos that had fresh avocado, a spicy mayo dip on the side, lettuce, tomatoes, served on 2-double tortillas with rice.  The wine menu is generic, but I had a nice glass of Santa Barbara Wine Company Chardonnay along with a 2nd glass of generic White Zin.

It was definitely one of the go to restaurants on this small pier and we really didn't have to wait that long to be seated. There was seating both outside and inside, but we decided to sit indoors since it was a bit windy and hot outside since we were literally in the ocean on the pier.

My boyfriend got us the shrimp cocktail salad and the 4lb (maybe it was 6lbs lolz) crab to share that was the special of the day. But out waiter had informed us that they ran out of the specific crab we wanted, but gave us two different crabs that was equivalent to the weight of the crab that we missed out on.

Once our food arrived, we dug right in. Everything tasted, so delicious and fresh. We finished off everything that we ordered and made sure not to leave any sort of crab meat morsel behind. The shrimp salad was surprisingly good. It was light and the shrimps were juicy. The crabs had their own different flavors and came with really crispy onion rings on the side and melted butter.

The inside is lovely too, nice couches and seating + it is a little cooler on a hot day and warmer on a cool day to sit inside. 

The wine is really good. I've done both the regular tasting and the reserve and enjoyed all of the wine. Pro tip: 2-for-1 tastings with the Axxess Pass.

I was visiting Santa Barbara with my aunt and daughter and we had no idea where to eat dinner. I'm gluten intolerant, so I have to check for gluten free options everywhere I go. It's usually not a problem at most restaurants. I was surprised how many restaurants (on the pier and around State St.) had no gluten-free options. We walked into the Bluewater Grill and were immediately welcomed. We felt right at home and even though they don't have a gluten-free menu, the hostess was quick to point out all of the (many) gluten-free possibilities. Our server was also extremely helpful. He had a strong grasp of the menu and my options, but still offered to double-check with the chef to make sure I was taken care of. He was equally attentive to my daughter's nut allergy, and went the extra mile to ensure there was no cross-contamination with her food.

Gavin took a couple of phone calls with my wife, Caitlin, and I leading up to the event and was friendly, capable and thoughtful. With his very easy-to-use website allowing us to slate selected songs -- and, perhaps, more importantly, create a comprehensive ""no play"" list -- as well as allowing our guests to share their requests, planning was easy. On the final call prior to the wedding where we went over those choices, my wife and I agreed that we could hear the wheels turning in Gavin's brain as he looked through our music. He seemed, almost, to be putting together playlists right in front of us.

On the big day, Gavin worked very well with our ceremony guitarist and our officiant at the ceremony site (Santa Barbara Courthouse Gardens), as well as with our guitarist who performed during cocktail hour at the reception (Chase Palm Park Plaza). Once it was Gavin's turn to take over, his playlist and rotation of songs through the dinner hour was impeccable and he handled the announcements of the wedding party and toast speeches like a pro. No silly bluster, just very professional and on top of things.

Leading up to the wedding, we told Gavin we really wanted the last 2.5 hours of the reception to be a big dance party. To say he got that idea would be a major understatement. The dance floor was packed as Gavin hit all the right notes, handled guest requests on site and just kept the party going non-stop right to the end. 

We had an amazing wedding day and Gavin was a crucial player in that. Thanks Gavin!

When deciding on our venue, pretty much our only prospect was the Riviera Mansion.  Once I found out that they had the date we were hoping for, we booked it immediately without looking into any other venues.  Having never planned a wedding before, I was at first very overwhelmed with all of the details that are involved.  One of the best things about the Riviera Mansion is that they provide all tables and chairs, linens and everything else for the table, unless you want to rent your own.  They do all of the food and beverage and have a very extensive food and drink menu with any option you can imagine!  You can put together your perfect menu and package.  

We had our ceremony there as well, and it was so beautiful and convenient!  Our reception was flawless, and the food was absolutely amazing (our guests are still talking about the food!)  We danced all night until 11:30pm which is a much later last call time than most other venues and hotels.  

The very best part about the Riviera Mansion is the staff.  I cannot say enough good things about everyone that works there.  Breanna is the event coordinator and she was so thorough throughout the entire process!  She took time to meet with me several times and gave me tons of advice and was there all day long the day of the wedding making sure everything was perfect.  Eli, the food and beverage director was there the entire night and took care of everything!  He was so accommodating and made sure that we had everything we needed. Chef Harley and his team made the best food, and the servers and bartenders took care of us all night long and were so sweet to all of our guests.  They made the experience what it was and it is rare these days to find such impeccable service from start to finish, but we sure found it!

I would HIGHLY recommend the Riviera Mansion to anyone, and I plan on telling all of my engaged friends to seriously consider having it there.  Having been to many other weddings in Santa Barbara, I really do think that this is the best wedding venue in town.  It is so much more exclusive than having it at a hotel, and much more convenient than doing it at a private estate.  We had the entire mansion to ourselves all day long which was so helpful.  The guys have their own game room with pool tables and a TV so they can hang out and the bridal suite is upstairs and is so charming.

Vt3gsOf4LMs68XJBxFRFiA,SUAFCKtkx8RrQ6EgJQIVrw,CWdCNIJU4Kh480NV9dgQjw,5,6,2,2,"4-star beer, 5-star ambiance. This is the most impressive and promising brewery in Santa Barbara. 

Inside they have a high ceiling, exposed wood rafters and black underlayment with an array of chalkboard panels for the tap list. It looks like the tap list changes by switching out these large panels, which give you the beer name and its essential characteristics like IBUs, ABV, style, volume poured. The list looked inspired with a range of styles from sours, Berliners, stouts, pilsners, and IPAs.

They offer very nice tasting flights, which our group did. You grab a draft list and just tick the ones you want to try. This system takes a lot of work and annoyance out of the process - a great idea. The beer quality was a bit all over the place, which is expected from a new brewery. However, some showed a lot of promise and I think Third Window has what it takes to improve their recipes. Detailed notes are below. I ended up liking their pilsner, The Light, the best and got it in a large format mug pour. 

Pretzels and popcorn are available, which is a nice touch. Dog friendly interior is a huge bonus as well.

~~~~~~~~~

Extra feedback for beer nerds and the brewery:

The Light 1.1
This was an outstanding German style pilsner with a bright lemon lime nose with beautiful citrus zestiness. Hefty carbonation and brilliant clarity much appreciated. The flavor was dry and a tad powdery, but the finish was neutral and refreshing. This was my absolute favorite of the beers I tried so I got a large pour in a giant mug. 

Brett Saison
Looking beautiful in the glass, glowing neon yellow with generous carbonation. The aroma is sawdust, barn, candied mango. The flavor is bubbly, neautral, and very dry but not abrasive. Refreshing, though a tad washed out in the flavor.

Rakau Welch
Looking identical to the Brett saison but with a more impressive aroma with fresh corn grits, lemongrass, dill, fennel, oregano - super herbal. The flavor is dry, neutral, refreshing. The farmyard character of saison is spot on here. Simple, dry, but not abrasive.

Xexo
Super dry for an IPA that wants to deliver sticky caramel aromas and flavor, but the palate is way too washed out and the bitterness becomes abrasive. Needed some work. 

The ÖKO BOMB
Inky black in color, but much too thin a body for stout. The nose is savory chocolate mousse, big raisin, chocolate covered raisin. But the flavor is too dry and moves to grape soda, grape cough syrup and tootsie roll.

Executioner's Daughter
Clear amber in color. This one had intense vinegar (acetic acid) and nail polish remover (ethyl acetate) in the nose. Taste is very nice, however, with cinnamon, mild sugar, dark bread, banana nut bran muffin. Great mouthfeel.

Noticed it now because we just drank the bottle of wine we bought when were were here. We were *slightly* inebriated by the time we got to this one, near the end, so I was only like 80% confident that the wine we purchased (a viognier) after tasting it was as good as I remembered, but nope, totally was, it was a great viognier. 

The view is definitely their claim to fame (hanging out with such a great view while slightly inebriated is one of the better things you can do in SB), but judging exclusively on that one viognier, their wine probably isn't half bad either. (We didn't do a full tasting - we had a coupon to taste one specific wine, but we asked if we could use it to taste one wine of our choice instead, a request they would have been silly to reject, since it meant us tasting a wine we'd actually be likely to purchase, which, sure enough, we did.

Rarely have I ever had a bad experience and I always recommend Something's Fishy to folks from out of town who want a fun experience.  Not only is their sushi the best price in town (half off, all the time) but their hibachi is to die for!  Always, always, always get the fried rice!  My family is completely spoiled because their fried rice is so good.  It doesn't taste as good anywhere else.  Nearly every single hibachi chef I have had does a great job with entertaining, although every now and then (typically during the lunch hour) I have had a chef who is new/learning, so he didn't do as many tricks.  Every now and then a chef will come up with something completely different that I've never seen before, and that's always a treat!

I have had their halibut, chicken, shrimp, and steak and all of it is good.  You can't go wrong.  The best deal you can get is their deluxe filet mignon dinner which comes with miso soup, salad with an amazing ginger dressing, fried rice, grilled vegetables, and mochi ice cream for dessert.  The filet mignon simply melts in your mouth.  Exquisite.

Save room for dessert because their fried green tea ice cream is without a doubt one of my favorite desserts of all time.  You get the fried tempura outside that is warm and crunchy with the refreshing green tea ice cream center... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

This place is definitely worth your time, but it does get busy during dinner, especially on the weekends.  So if you have a large group, I would highly recommend calling and making a reservation.

We ordered a flight of five tasters for $10 - an absolute bargain. The beer list was a little heavy on the Belgians, but as someone who's normally not a fan of Belgians, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked each beer. The Oats of Fealty was my favorite, but the Vineration of Saints (includes riesling grapes!) was very interesting as well. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly, and easily answered our (numerous) questions about the beers. They also have a great menu display that tells you about each drink's essential notes and characteristics.

Lots of seating in a spacious, airy ambiance. Also right next door to a winery and a restaurant. You can't bring wine/beer back and forth, understandably, but you can order food from the restaurant to wherever you are.

We walked here from State Street, which took about ten minutes. I'm not sure I'd want to do the walk at night, but in the middle of the afternoon it was safe and comfortable.

This place was fun, but it didn't really stand out.  The bartender was a lovely girl who did a good job of chatting us up.  I think Sycophant #1 might have fallen in love with her.

There is a decent selection of draft beers.  I liked it.

The only negative is that the bartender told Evil that we can only get up on the little stages if we were a girl and mostly nude.  This made us sad...because A) we didn't get to go up on the stage as we're a man (a manly man!) and B) there weren't any mostly nude girls in the bar while we were there.

We had searched ALL over the LA area before making the decision to go up to Santa Barbara, which we have strong ties to anyway. Nothing in LA met everything we wanted like the mansion did - BEAUTIFUL venue, outdoor ceremony, with your choice of indoor or outdoor reception, ample parking, a later curfew (what fun is it if have to shut down too early!), amazing menu, awesome rooms for both bride and groom to get ready, ability to use candles/open flames, etc, etc. The beautiful, classic Santa Barbara style of the building stole our hearts. For us, the venue was a bit of a splurge, but completely worthwhile because it made planning that much easier. Breanna was EXCELLENT to work with. I had a million, little random detailed questions at the end and she was always extremely helpful and thorough to get back to me. On the day of, I was still a little hectic about things and realized pretty quickly that there were so many details they were willing to take care of for me that I had anticipated. We had one minor hiccup during the day - the gentleman who ran the catering did not want to match the seating chart I had made. This was really frustrating because they had provided the seating chart (I had wanted to go out of the box with a straight table arrangement but had been in communication with them on it). I wouldn't knock them any points, because in they end, they accommodated what I had asked for, and Breanna was really gracious to apologize for the problem and help get everything back on track. When that is the only hiccup for your entire wedding day, you can't complain! Last but not least, the food was delicious. We got a lot of compliments on the food and happy guests throughout the whole night. They loved the venue and thought it was so cool to have the whole house and grounds to move around.

Breanna worked very well with all of our vendors and made sure that everything ran smoothly on our big day. Awesome prep spaces for the groomsmen and bridesmaids. The food was incredible - it is hard to consistently make 100 good meals and our guests were raving about the quality of the food. We also planned a late night snack (pulled pork sliders) that were unbelievably good. We had two signature cocktails that were delicious also. The decor was great and there are many spaces (front lawn, dance floor, lounge area, patio, library) with great functionality. Our photographer also took us across the street to the park for some great photos. Staff was polite and attentive. Overall, we could not recommend Riviera Mansion highly enough.

The BRUNCH is off the hook, same price as Jeannine's but you're eating in an art museum with French tapestries, elegant flatware, beauty in every corner of the room. 

I don't know how ANYONE could give this less than 5 stars. Now, at dinner it's apparently pricey. Duh. This is a fine dining institution in Santa Barbara and it's French with a star LA chef and the owners spared no expense in the remodeling of the casual, not divey but not nice, State and A which managed to stay in business a couple decades in spite of the subpar food. 

It turns out the owners have grown daughters in NYC and I have so enjoyed my afternoon here. My iPhone 5 makes a hotspot so I'm blogging before I meet a friend at 4 and swim to work off the potato daphinois--don't ask about the fat content--a sinful tower of thinly sliced potatoes with cheese and oil and all manner of terrible things which taste wonderful. 

My scramble--a bargain at 12.95--included perfect carmelized onions, roasted peppers, spinach and a hint of goat cheese--and I will dream of this till my next brunch here after Chicago/Michigan trip. 

After 5 cups of coffee to wake me up from horrible asthmatic night, I had a glass of the Ballard Pinot for dessert Nice but no better than the cheaper--9/glass--Kenwood Cab which I think is quite a respectable Cab for the money. 

The coffee is good but if you're like my father who, due to his time in the military, requires coffee which scalds the tongue, you will need to pull a Dad and ask them to nuke it in the ""radar oven."" It's not hot but I don't really care as it tasted good and did the trick: that is, it enabled me to have two glasses of wine after a miserable night of wheezing, hacking and blowing my nose. 

I cannot say enough for Maggie's and am so happy it's here in SB. I will come before my next show at the Granada for dinner at the bar. I have a subscription (see Yelp) and come alone.

PS I haven't eaten here at dinner yet but every single person who brought me food or booze was fabulous and I got to chat at length with the spectacular, smart owner with whom it turns out I have quite a bit culturally in common.

All our food was delicious (between the three of us we had the Build a Hash, 3 Egg White Frittata, and the House Cured Salmon, each having the fresh squeezed orange juice, too). I cannot wait to return when I get a chance to come to SB again... I wish we had something like this where I live.

Santa Barbara is known for their super fresh seafood, so we were delighted to find that there was the perfect spot, at the end of the pier.  We came at around 11:30am, which was perfect, because we beat the big lunch rush.  We were seated within 15 minutes, so we just enjoyed our view of the ocean while we waited.  You're also able to order up at the window and eat at one of the picnic tables they have set up on the pier if you don't feel like waiting. 

We were seated outside, so we were literally eating a few yards from the edge of the pier.  It was beautiful.  

The four of us shared a pitcher of Hefenweizen, which paired deliciously with all of the food to come.  Light, refreshing, and the view was a big plus.  And the whole pitcher was only $18!

We started off with an appetizer and shared a dozen of the Morrow Bay Oysters and Kusshi Oysters.  The Morrow Bays were bigger than the Kusshi, so I expected a saltier, less sweet taste.  It was actually just as sweet and the smaller, Kusshi Oysters.  I was pleasantly surprised, and these were both very fresh!  

For my main course, I ordered the half MAINE LOBSTER, which also came with Onion Rings and a soup-- I went with the LOBSTER BISQUE.  The half Maine Lobster was super fresh and tender.  The tail was a little chewy, but better than a lot of lobsters I've had lately.  My favorite part was the super meaty claw!  It came out of the shell beautifully with ease, and melted like butter in my mouth.  I didn't even need the side of melted butter!  This dish was simple and sweet.  The Lobster Bisque was good, but nothing I'd be craving.  I hoped that there would be at least a few pieces of lobster in it, but I think they just used lobster for the flavor.  Oh!  The Onion Rings here are amazing.  Light, crisp, and flakey!

My friends ordered the Lobster Roll and the Rock Crab Claws (the rounder shaped claws with the black tips).  The Lobster Roll looked amazing, and it wasn't super drenched in mayo either.  I noticed that my friend didn't eat the roll-- it looked pretty basic/grocery store bought.  It would be nice if they used a buttery, toasted, baguette, as I've seen in other restaurants.  The Rock Crab Claws were fresh and meaty, I must order this one next time.

And you will see staff cleaning while you're there.  You will also see 5 + huge flat screens on the wall, along with vending machines filled with laundry necessities and snacks/drinks.  The machines: various sizes of commercial grade washers & dryers.  Washers range from $3-$6.50 and dryers are $.25 or $.50 for 7-8 minutes (depends on size).  
There are always staff around and they're nice and helpful.  I think they also offer washing/folding services - ask the front desk.  
Parking is not usually an issue unless it's peak after work hours.  Walk to Starbucks while you wait - or sit at one of their tables or chairs and enjoy their free wifi.  Forget the quarters- this place uses laundry cards you can refill on your Visa/MasterCard.
This place puts my old laundromat to shame, and it's closer to home, cleaner, nicer and all around better (no more quarters!!!!!!)

So for starters - I ordered the lobster roll. The dish was not to my liking, but that's because I'm not a fan of celery in lobster rolls. The celery was diced but it was too much and it overpowered the dish. I also found the lobster overdressed. But some of this is just a matter of taste so I won't ding them hard for that.

The rest of the food, given the price, was fantastic. The crab and lobster were all fresh, all cooked correctly, and all at a price that worked.

Located in a small plaza, parking was convenient. They had about 8 spaces in front of the cafe. You can't miss it. Exterior looks just like a garage. Rolled up two car garage with just open air seating. Very clean, white, and minimalist. There are more than enough tables and chairs for studying, working, or chatting. To the left is where they display all their merch, couch with board games. 

I know the name screams BREAKFAST, but this is not really a breakfast joint. It's more of a coffee / tea / pastry place. They have a small menu for drinks and a small pastry case. I'm not a coffee person, but I tried their Matcha latte with almond milk and that was flavorful! Their chocolate chip cookie is delish. Such a hip and clean space. Restrooms located outside, and shares it with the other establishment next door. So glad we made the decision to stop by here first before exploring the rest of SB. Definitely a place I'd like to chill at.

tBvtYn1PZ4FPIxDkoEqZKw,d2AJV_CvbAffRSM-DzERFw,SZU9c8V2GuREDN5KgyHFJw,4,0,0,0,"I love this place. I came here for the second time last weekend and as far as seafood goes, it will never let me down.

The only reason I took off a star was because I listed my family's name down and they skipped over it. We came for lunch on a Saturday at 2:00pm and I had listed my name, then crossed the first one out since it was a bit messy, then wrote it again right next to it. After about 25 minutes of waiting, they call our names, say the table will be ready soon, and never call us again. We figure out that our name has already been crossed off. UGH! So, we had to list our name again and waited another 15 minutes. In total, we waited approximately 40 minutes -____-

Anyways, we had their oyster shooters, rock crab, lobster, lobster tacos, and calamari sandwich - all of which were very good. Very fresh! Very tasty! The lobster and crab also came with soup and salad beforehand. The clam chowder is amazing. It's so good. I don't know how they do it. Maybe it's something with the clams and fresh seafood. 

Overall, I love this place. I understand it was a misunderstanding that our names were crossed off the list, but still, if I didn't love this place, I wouldn't have waited that extra 15 minutes.",2012-09-13 18:09:56,Santa Barbara Shellfish Company,230 Stearns Wharf,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4087147,-119.6850187,4.0,2404,1,"{'OutdoorSeating': 'True', 'RestaurantsAttire': ""'casual'"", 'RestaurantsReservations': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'NoiseLevel': ""u'average'"", 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'RestaurantsGoodForGroups': 'False', 'WiFi': ""u'no'"", 'Alcohol': ""'beer_and_wine'"", 'RestaurantsTakeOut': 'True', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': True, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'HasTV': 'False', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'False', 'GoodForKids': 'True', 'Caters': 'False', 'Ambience': ""{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': True}"", 'RestaurantsDelivery': 'True', 'HappyHour': 'False', 'Music': ""{u'dj': False, u'live': False, u'jukebox': False, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': False, u'no_music': False}"", 'GoodForMeal': ""{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': True, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': False, u'dessert': False}"", 'CoatCheck': 'False', 'BestNights': ""{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': True, u'sunday': False}"", 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Live/Raw Food, Restaurants, Seafood, Beer Bar, Beer, Wine & Spirits, Bars, Food, Nightlife","{'Monday': '0:0-0:0', 'Tuesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Wednesday': '11:0-21:0', 'Thursday': '11:0-14:0', 'Friday': '11:0-21:0', 'Saturday': '11:0-21:0', 'Sunday': '11:0-21:0'}",1,love place came second time last weekend far seafood go never let reason took star listed family name skipped came lunch saturday pm listed name crossed first one since bit messy wrote right next minute waiting call name say table ready soon never call u figure name already crossed ugh list name waited another minute total waited approximately minute anyways oyster shooter rock crab lobster lobster taco calamari sandwich good fresh tasty lobster crab also came soup salad beforehand clam chowder amazing good know maybe something clam fresh seafood overall love place understand misunderstanding name crossed list still love place would waited extra minute

We found out about this place through Yelp reviews. No reservations - expect to put your name down and wait (we were told 2 hours but in the end we waited for less than an hour as people probably dropped off the waiting list or weren't there when their names were called). We ordered the lobster pasta which was yummy - the meat could've been more tender but it was flavorful. My bro and his gf ordered the rock crab (comes with clam chowder, salad and onion rings) which was delicious but took ages to eat, as everyone can attest it's not the easiest food to crack into (pun not intended lol). My dad ordered the abalone on tomato basil rice. I don't eat abalone but the rice was good although a little on the salty side. We were still not full so finished up with the beer boiled shrimp which was probably the highlight of the meal.

Ioi_RMBvhEAYZg0vjeRwrw,5mo4zCTWU_MQf1tdGAoV4g,O6RCCmz8-x4NhWJpI8KQug,4,0,0,0,"I admire Breakfast for opening their space to all-ages shows, regularly featuring artists' photos, paintings, even sculptures, and hosting casual food pop ups. 

I know many reviewers have said the left side of the shop is gimmicky and ""too hip"" (branded merch, surf/skate mags, and comfy chairs), but the last time I was here kids were loving the connect four out on the table-- what's to hate about that? 

That said, their espresso can be hit or miss, and sometimes my Gibraltar milk is a little too hot and a little too fluffy, but they use good beans and their drip brew is great.

The staff was friendly and accommodating.  There is a pool and a hot tub, all looked very clean and inviting.  There are lots of tables/umbrellas/chairs,etc all around the pool.  The rooms came with two complimentary waters which we were more than happy to take advantage of.  They even give you chocolates on your pillow!  Oh, and free internet too!  

The rooms were very clean and I love when the sink and mirrors aren't in the bathroom so that you can get ready when the actual bathroom is being used.

+ The staff in the office (both the male manager and female staff) were super nice and friendly.
+ Free/included parking.  They even let us begin parking before our hotel room was ready, since we arrived to town hours before the check-in hours.
+ Our room ended up being available earlier than check-in, so we were glad we could tidy up and do some freshening up earlier on.
+ Good size room.  (We actually had a couch in addition to the bed!)
+ Continental breakfast.
- Not a huge breakfast... but we just ended up at Sambo's anyway.

The price was reasonable during the New Years (holiday) weekend and the owners were very nice and helpful. I have never been to Santa Barbara and they gave us directions to the best places to eat and tour around. The Inn is not too far from the main street which I completely forgot the name. but it's about a quick 10 minute walk by the beach to the pier. From there you can take the trolley up and down around the area for a quarter! Another great thing is the continental breakfast!!! Any place that serves food is my favorite place. :)

Room wise I was surprised to see a nice, clean, welcome feeling room. We had the double bed room on the second floor and it was huge and spacious. The bathroom was nice and well kept. Not dirty or yucky like some ""Inns."" My friends who are OCD even liked the rooms! The only two things I would complain about is that they only allow one parking spot per room because of the limited space. I understand, but it sucks to have the other couple look for street parking. Luckily there were spots, you just need to read the signs! Also, the shower heads were a pain. For some reason, the knob to turn the shower head on wouldn't stay on!

4sEDAriL5Cm9CSD50uo9Bw,FApyZ8GXlYr0uWsfgP0Q1g,UvIDb2FiDCgPuVtDT2rGew,5,2,0,0,"We did a significant amount of research on DJs for our Santa Barbara wedding- we ended up meeting with 3 different DJs in person (sigh- who knew it would be such a process). 

My husband was very specific about what music we wanted. We also knew that we wanted a DJ who would be able to ""read the crowd""- we wanted our wedding to be a big happy party where the mood felt good and the people kept dancing. Finally, we did NOT want an MC-type DJ who was going to be ""center stage"". 

When meeting with Gavin and Patrick, I got the sense that they knew their job was: help us get what we wanted (e.g. if we wanted a DJ to deal with making the music good and the party fun and not saying too much at all, they would do that) . I feel that if we'd wanted something different, they would have been able to provide that as well.

DJ Patrick from SBDJs did a stellar job. We were able to submit song lists on their website in advance, and they will get songs for you not in their list if you request them (up to a fairly generous limit, I think). We emailed him a special recording we wanted for part of our first dance, which we wanted mixed in a very specific way into another song, which he did perfectly. 

But those are the things a DJ is *supposed* to be able to do. What made him truly outstanding is that the dancing went on all night. Everyone commented on what great music and what a fun atmosphere it was. He played music we requested, but seamlessly picked similar-genre songs to complement it (some not from our extensive request list). Most importantly, he perfectly ""read the crowd"", and if a particular song wasn't working for our crowd, he subtly and skillfully mixed it into another song, and moved on to something better. 

We all have been to those weddings where a song comes on, and a minute later the dance floor is empty and yet the song limps on. Or where the DJ realizes it isn't working and literally *turns off* the song, pause, then starts a new one while the confused dancers stand around. We had NONE of that.

She did a great job, but I was feeling really uncomfortable, which I thought (due to the bruising) was to be expected.  Still I took the chance to stop in and talk to Ricky at Golden Eagle (at the very least I knew I was going to look for better jewelry once it healed).  Ricky was great!!!!  He looked at the original ball I had chosen for my piercing and knew straight away that if I just changed the ball for something a bit bigger and smoother, I would be more comfortable.  He warned me with my bruising that it might hurt to change the ball, but he was so gentle it was an easy switch.  I immediately felt better and am 100% better just a day and a half later.

I've had some bad experiences. 

I've just gotten new insurance and moved to the area and made an appointment here. 
My appointment was at 10, and I was paying and leaving 25 minutes later. (I'm sure it didn't hurt that I was the first appointment of the day, but still. Awesome.) 

I know my prescription, I knew what I wanted (i've had so many doctors get pushy with new fancy contact lenses and shopping for glasses frames in a place has never gone well for me - these decisions take time! (plus, I mean, the internet is 700% cheaper for frames, always)) but today was just exam/and contact ordering and Dr. Neel was friendly and SUPREMELY EFFICIENT which, to me, can't be ranked highly enough. It's an errand, and as doctor's offices go, it's not a painful one by any means, but still. I don't want to spend my whole day there. 

So, it was awesome. There's free parking in the garage on Figueroa up to the first 75 minutes and then i think it's 1.50 an hour after that? Not bad, says I, having just moved from LA. Plus, did I mention how long I was there? NOT LONG! It was definitely a free parking scenario for moi.

Be aware if you've never been before (ie, me) that the address is on State Street but it's in one of those offshooty areas with a bunch of shops in it. Look for bronze Ben Franklin.

All great seafood stops should be reservation free and first come first serve.  

If you have to wait for 15 minutes not a big deal, if it's 3 hours it can be a bit discouraging. I saw the guy clear a whole page of names on the list because no one bothered to stick around and wait. When your name is on the middle of the 3rd page I totally understand being discouraged,  especially when you get hungry. I think we got lucky.   

We started off with some clam strips (served with onion rings, tarter and cocktail sauce) and a cup of clam chowder. We ordered it right when we were seated at the bar and it cam within a couple of minutes. We decided to get the Cioppino and split it. I have never had Cioppino in a bread bowl before but it makes the perfect companion. All of the soup soaks in to the bread. It was a healthy sized serving to split. A bunch of crab, scollops, shrimp and clams. They ask you how spicy you want it, we went with a more mild soup and it was perfect for us, just a little bit of kick.  

They have a good selection of wine and beer. I was really happy they had Anchor Steam on tap, it goes really good with seafood. They also have a fairly decent Bloody Mary.

When we got back for dinner the champagne, strawberries, and candles we all set up perfectly! My girlfriend was very surprised. Then they helped me schedule a couples massage that evening, which was another surprise. So the first afternoon / evening there was absolutely perfect.

The vibe of this inn is very boutique, quaint, and charming. Perfect for couples. We could also use the bikes daily (for free), which we did. They gave us great suggestions on where to go and what to do. Both State Street, the beach, and the train station are all walking distance.

I cannot say enough what a pleasure it was to work with Breanna, the venue manager and Eli, the food and beverage director. Our wedding here was a destination wedding, so we were very concerned about making sure all of our family and friends that travelled a long way to get to our wedding had a good time. Being a couple straight out of grad school, we were also very concerned with keeping the cost manageable. Everything worked out on all accounts! 

We first picked the venue for two reasons: the price was right and the venue is GORGEOUS. The pricing was very straightforward, which we really appreciated, and when looking at other options in the Santa Barbara area, the Riviera mansion was pretty comparable with other venues which are not all inclusive (ones where you have to find your own caterer, rent linens, etc etc). Planning a wedding without a coordinator and from across the country, it was also definitely worth it for us to go with a venue that minimized the amount of details we would have to think about.

The looks and layout of the place are what sold us though. With people coming from the east coast and middle of the country, we wanted something that would really showcase Santa Barbara's cool architecture and vibe. The mansion is exactly that.  The layout is also pretty perfect for a multigenerational wedding. We were able to enjoy the California weather for our ceremony and cocktail hour outside, then go inside for dinner, avoiding the cooler night air. Later, we could turn up the party in the bar/dance floor area, while the older folks talked and relaxed on the couches in the living room. It really has something for everyone.

What I didn't realize when we picked it was how absolutely awesome all the staff would be to work with. Breanna was super helpful, answering all my questions promptly and pleasantly, and accommodating my sometimes short notice visits to the area. When we did our walkthrough a couple of days before the wedding, Breanna and Eli paid attention to every detail and made sure we were taken care of, as they did the day of the wedding too. Eli was incredibly attentive and easy to work with! My dad is in the restaurant industry and was in charge of setting up desserts (we had family make some traditional desserts, as well as got some cupcakes from Enjoy Cupcakes- also a great idea!). Eli worked with him to get whatever he needed, risers, tablecloths, etc and was really sweet about it. 

The attention to bartending at the Riviera Mansion deserves a paragraph of its own. Breanna worked with me and the bartender (who's name I forget but has worked there for 20 years and is also incredibly awesome) to create a peach moscow mule as our signature drink (our colors were peach and green) and get it to taste just right. She even arranged it so we had fresh peaches! At the wedding, everyone raved about them, even guests who usually prefer something more manly sounding. The staff had all drinks ready to go for our cocktail hour, and also passed trays of drinks, so there was never a line at the bar (something guests also specifically mentioned that they appreciated). Hell, Eli even followed me with my drink for a couple of minutes around dinner since my hands were full of other things! Really spectacular and attentive service.

One of those places when you step in the door, you instantly feel like you're on vacation. It's warm, inviting atmosphere is so comfortable you'll want to take a nap in front of the fire after a glass of wine. There's a fireplace in the corner with a cozy set-up, you'll swear you're in a living room of a snug b&b. Also, a bar where you can sit and speak with one of the knowledgable and friendly members of their staff about what kind of wine you'd like to try.

Great place for a date, girls night or if you want to have a wine tasting experience in a great atmosphere. They offer several different tasting flights of wine (and beer) for a really reasonable price. If you're a regular, look into getting a membership. I spent hours here with a friend sipping wine and relaxing. A must see spot if you like great wine and conversation.

Jason is my favorite and I am trust him so much I drove 600 miles round trip to have him do this piece! He has a way with figuring out when I mean when I am using all the wrong terms and coming up with something way better than anything I imagined. I believe his favorite styles to do are Japanese and Traditional. 

The staff was really nice, one guy even did a bunch of video for me! There is also some nice local color, like this retarded guy that hangs out at the shop! Bonus! I had such a great time I had to have Jason stop tattooing while I shook with laughter on the table a couple times.

The do piercing and have a pretty decent selection of jewelry, too. 

Cash only folks, they do have an atm and don't forget to tip your artist well.

My husband had the rock crab special which came with a Caesar salad and clam chowder. The clam chowder was excellent. He usually adds pepper but said it came seasoned just the way he liked it.  The crab was great too, a great deal and very high quality.

Our son had the chicken strips, he ate 3 out of 4 of them, which means they must have been good!

We had a pitcher of Firestone, they actually have a very good selection of beers on tap as well as by the bottle.

They have a really cute patio and the best part, they  have these vents on the ground so when they turn the heaters on, it heats up your feet and legs vs. the heaters that heat up your face (I hate those).  This seriously has to be the most amazing thing ever!  The food was amazing!  We ordered the grilled asparagus for our appetizer and it was phenomenol and they bring out yummy garlic bread.  My sister and I split the calamari steak sandwich and got 2 sides of soup:  the black bean and the chili.  We got fries for our side and they were good as well.  The calamari sandwich was pan fried and on sourdough bread with the fixings on the side, including tarter sauce.  All the food was delicious!!!  I willl definitely go back.  I would give it 5 stars for the food, but the service wasn't 5 stars.  It started out great, but then our server just disappeared.  I had to ask the host to get our  server and she just asked what we needed, I told her refills on our drinks, so she just refilled our drinks herself and we never did see our server.

For one, the seafood is fresh. In fact we saw fishermen come in to drop off a new catch of crabs. 

Clam chowder is a must have. Easily one of the best. Rock crab special was good though a bit salty for my taste. Get ready to get dirty because you'll need to get cracking. Onion rings that came as a side were a great addition.

We loved how we could use the space the entire day to get ready in, and our guests had free rein of the entire space all night. The venue doesn't require much in terms of decorations either because it's already so beautiful! We were so happy with how everything we brought in just elevated the space since you really don't need much! 

The rooms to get ready in were also great. The Groom and Groomsmen hung out in the billards rooms for hours and played pool and relaxed. The room upstairs for the girls to get ready in is really beautiful and lends itself to great photos. There's also tuns of natural light, which is great. 

Breanna, the venue coordinator, is a dream! She was so amazing to work with. Some venders take days to respond to you, but not Breanna. She would respond right away and offered some great advice and information each time. She was so helpful and really made sure the day was everything we wanted it to be. You can't ask for a better person to work with when you're planning a huge event!

We really tried to use the entire space as best as possible, because each part was so unique and beautiful in it's own right. We did our cocktail hour outside on the lawn and a sit down dinner in the dining room. We did the photobooth and cake cutting in the living room and desserts and coffee in the library. Our guests loved that they weren't confined to the dance floor or their table all night.

The store is huge, crammed with racks of different simple, flowy one-size-fits-all separates and outfits. Each cut comes in many different colors. You like how one of their shirts fits you? You can pretty much buy it in any shade you want. Although the store looks very busy and some items have busy patterns, many of the pieces are elegant, modern and minimal and available in solid shades.

I am a size small and found a lot of the tops to be flattering. Some tops and dresses were in the $50 range but the ones I happened to love were closer to $100. There were several $20 sale racks so I got a psychedelic pair of purple pants that I hope I will wear someday. I've already worn my non-sale black top many times in the last few weeks.

Staff were present and friendly. One employee started a dressing room for me and when I got to the room I saw she had styled the items I gave her with accessories and complimentary pieces. Above and beyond what I expected, although the additions were not really my style so I didn't try them on. A very nice gesture, though and potentially helpful for the right customer.

My Labs and I took a vacation after 3years, travelled throughout northern California and I remembered how much we loved Santa Barbara. I had not booked a hotel as we arrived to town. Pulled over at a parking lot, called Casa Del Mar and Dan answered the phone. He made it so easy, so easy for us. He was brilliant. Now it is hard to have a fully loaded truck, two cargos and my dogs. They charge extra per dog which is amazing, instead of limiting you to size or number. 
He gave us a beautiful corner room at the end. Very clean room, I absolutely loved the shower, it had pressure, it is indeed important for long hair. The bed was so comfy and the mattress amazing. We slept like babies:) the room had everything I needed. Loved the tile floor. 
Dan gave me all the info about the great sip and taste at the lobby, complimentary breakfast in the morning. But above all he gave me the tips of how to get to the dog beach. Provided me with a map to look around. He was always with a smile and so engaging to all my questions. He was brilliant!  I have to say John was also great. He was wonderful about the check out time and he was so kind to thank me for staying with them. Beautiful.

fgFQS3AD8CZUCF5fmcpRGw,acYG_L-chbfRYGMdmERXpA,x6ByESFVanIYcomQsXQYGw,4,0,0,0,"Hailing from a big, bustling city with many professional salons, I was a bit hesitant in finding a stylist in Santa Barbara. In turn, I went onto Yelp to find somewhere to go as I was in need of a haircut. I read all these good reviews at 19 Blue for Savannah, so I went ahead and booked a haircut. 

Firstly, parking isn't bad - there are some meter spots right outside but worst case scenario you can park in the Paseo Nuevo parking lot and if you make it back in under 75 minutes, I'm pretty sure parking will be free. 

My first impression of the salon was that the ladies working there were extremely chatty, friendly, enthusiastic, and full of energy (which I loved). I checked in at the reception and waited less than five minutes until Savannah came over and introduced herself.

I told her what I wanted and she led me off to get my hair washed. One of my complaints was that the head and neck massage that I'm very used to in the salon back at home was missing! There was a little bit of massaging, but not enough to constitute it as a massage. Boo! That's usually the best and most relaxing part of getting my hair done and it wasn't there - major disappointment. 

Anyways, during the whole cut Savannah seemed very nice and genuine, making appropriate conversation but taking care not to be overly enthusiastic or fake which was nice. She did exactly as I asked and my hair felt great. This isn't the cheapest place to get your hair cut but I'm always paying $50+ because I have long hair that requires a little bit more time so I didn't think too much of it. 

Pros: friendly, efficient, listened to what I wanted, easy parking, and great results
Cons: missing head massage during shampoo
Verdict: I'll definitely be going back to Savannah from now on!",2011-09-30 02:57:33,19 Blue Salon,19 W Ortega St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4179736,-119.6984966,4.5,108,1,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True'}","Beauty & Spas, Hair Salons","{'Tuesday': '10:0-19:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-19:0', 'Thursday': '10:0-19:0', 'Friday': '10:0-19:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-19:0'}",1,hailing big bustling city many professional salon bit hesitant finding stylist santa barbara turn went onto yelp find somewhere go need haircut read good review blue savannah went ahead booked haircut firstly parking bad meter spot right outside worst case scenario park paseo nuevo parking lot make back minute pretty sure parking free first impression salon lady working extremely chatty friendly enthusiastic full energy loved checked reception waited le five minute savannah came introduced told wanted led get hair washed one complaint head neck massage used salon back home missing little bit massaging enough constitute massage boo usually best relaxing part getting hair done major disappointment anyways whole cut savannah seemed nice genuine making appropriate conversation taking care overly enthusiastic fake nice exactly asked hair felt great cheapest place get hair cut always paying long hair requires little bit time think much pro friendly efficient listened wanted easy parking great result con missing head massage shampoo verdict definitely going back savannah

Zen Yai is becoming my favorite Thai spot in SB.

The Basil Tofu dish is very delicious, what a great flavor! It's more like a mock-chicken, if you are in the know of vegetarian ""fake meats"". Even my carnivorous husband seems to prefer this dish.

The restaurant is small and can get warm, but the service is so friendly and efficient, that it ends up being fine. I am also a big fan of their appetizers - vegetarian egg rolls and the tofu satay.

After reading yelp reviews, I looked into The Eagle Inn and I was super happy with the choice! Since I booked the room at around 7 pm on Friday night, our room was only $140/night instead of $199/night. The room had two queen beds, and when we walked in, it was huge! When we walked in, a small hallway had entrances to the bathroom, a separate kitchen with a table and chairs, and the main room with 2 queen beds.

Since I knew we'd be arriving late (around 11:30 pm), I asked when I reserved the room if we'd be able to check in that late. I was given instructions and it was super easy and simple, which was nice because we were ready to go to sleep by the time we arrived.

We had free breakfast both days. Breakfast included coffee, tea, orange juice, a big bowl of fresh fruit, and a choice of two entrees. The first day we had vanilla yogurt with homemade granola, fresh berries and an english muffin, and spinach quiche. The second day we had the same yogurt/english muffin option, and a bagel with lox. All of the food was really good and the staff was really friendly. They also offered fresh chocolate chip cookies in the evening.

The inn is a couple blocks north of the ocean and a couple blocks west of State St-- both are quick walks. The Eagle Inn also has beach cruisers available to use for free, so we took them out along the beach.

We had a great time here! The whole inn was very clean and well-decorated, and I'd definitely be happy to stay here again!",2012-02-07 04:36:38,The Eagle Inn,232 Natoma Ave,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4105211033,-119.6943283081,4.5,368,1,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'WiFi': ""u'free'"", 'DogsAllowed': 'False', 'BusinessAcceptsBitcoin': 'False'}","Event Planning & Services, Hotels & Travel, Bed & Breakfast, Hotels","{'Monday': '8:0-22:0', 'Tuesday': '8:0-22:0', 'Wednesday': '8:0-22:0', 'Thursday': '8:0-22:0', 'Friday': '8:0-22:0', 'Saturday': '8:0-22:0', 'Sunday': '8:0-22:0'}",1,friend planning last minute trip santa barbara looking hotel looking place nice enough would feel relaxed ie vaguely mustyuncleanfeeling hotel chain reasonable price reading yelp review looked eagle inn super happy choice since booked room around pm friday night room night instead night room two queen bed walked huge walked small hallway entrance bathroom separate kitchen table chair main room queen bed since knew would arriving late around pm asked reserved room would able check late given instruction super easy simple nice ready go sleep time arrived free breakfast day breakfast included coffee tea orange juice big bowl fresh fruit choice two entree first day vanilla yogurt homemade granola fresh berry english muffin spinach quiche second day yogurtenglish muffin option bagel lox food really good staff really friendly also offered fresh chocolate chip cooky evening inn couple block north ocean couple block west state st quick walk eagle inn also beach cruiser available use free took along beach great time whole inn clean welldecorated would definitely happy stay

Although Santa Barbara is not known for fantastic Thai food, Zen Yai hits the spot when you're craving Thai food. I am particularly fond of their Panaang Curry with Chicken as its a nice and spicy dish. I've tried several other dishes as well, but the panaang curry is still my favorite. The curry is spicy but it also has depth and the green beans are still nice and crispy. I usually like Pad Thai, but I find that pad thai at zen yai can be a little inconsistent. Sometimes its great and other times the noodles are overcooked. I do, however enjoy the Spicy Fried Rice - big surprise! I LOVE spicy food!

This is one of the best acai and pitaya Bowl places that I have been too, ever. It's a little acai place by State Street but the line was out the door when we first arrived. Their menus are all written on chalkboards, and there are so many choices to choose from.

My company and I got the pitaya smoothies, the island pitaya Bowl, the berry bowl, and the green acai bowl with kale and ginger and lime. Let me tell you, we got Smalls and the portions were huge. I couldn't even finish mine. They say that honey is $0.50 extra, but they give everyone else honey if one person gets it.  The bowls range from around $8 to $11 and the smoothies were also about $8.  But for the price, the servings are large. 

The Taste, the freshness, the fruits strawberries, berries granola, even the acai we're all very delicious and worth the wait and the price.

As a New York native I live by the credo that only pizza which can be folded in half can actually be considered pizza. While the cheese to sauce ratio was slightly in favour of the queso the crust was solid enough to uphold the amount of grease, which personally I found refreshing.

But clean and modern designs don't really matter much if your wines are no good.  So I'm pleased to write that Deep Sea keeps up their end of the bargain with an assortment of pretty good wines.  Again, you wouldn't expect to find such a beautiful and relaxing spot with good wines in such an obvious location, but trust me, I wouldn't steer you wrong.

Here are my suggestions for your afternoon visiting Deep Sea.  First, spring for a tasting.  Either their regular one or the select tasting will be fine.  I think the regular is ten bucks and the select one is twenty.  Take your time on each of the wines and pick one that you can all agree on.

and the food...was GREAT!  they have quite a nice wine list with a focus on the local SB/saint ynez/los olivos region which was nice.  we had the ahi 2 ways, the asparagus salad, the shrimp, and scallops.  we dined tapas style and everything was fresh, prepared well with seasoning/accompaniments that added to and did not compete with the flavor of the main ingredient.  presentation and service again were professional and friendly.

We expected it to come with all the seafood out of their shells. Boy, were we terribly wrong! It literally came with a leg of rock crab, and mussels and clams in their shells. At least the shrimp was ready to eat. Thus, it was a bit hard to eat the bowl but still delicious. The bread bowl itself was a little stale but still yummy once drenched in the sauce.

Granted it was a Sunday and raining, but I was glad to see that we had the place to ourselves and the girl behind the counter looked happy to see us too lol.

The place is very roomy with two bars on each side and a fireplace and comfy seats in one corner. We had plently of room to stand around the bar and enjoy our drinks. The tasting packages are called ""flights"" and a basic wine flight is $5 for about five tastings.  They also had the beer flight which some of my friends ordered and for six tastings it was the same price. Great prices compared to the other wine tastings in the area which averaged about $10.

It's about a 10 minute walk to the harbor, the pier, the Funk Zone, and State St. and that's one of the main reasons we stay here.  The front desk staff are always friendly.  We've stayed in one of the Courtyard King rooms both times and it's like having your own little studio apartment.  It's convenient having the small kitchen and being able to roll out of bed and eat breakfast in our PJ's like we would at home.   There's also a sitting area with a fireplace as well as a large desk.  They have free wi-fi which we appreciate because we use our laptops, even on vacation.    

The Spanish architecture is charming and the decor inside is modern and comfortable.  The whole place has a romantic, yet carefree vibe, kind of like Santa Barbara itself.  Even though it's pricey on the weekends and in the summer, it's still less expensive than most places in Santa Barbara.  

The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the noise level.  Because the buildings are older, the windows and doors aren't sealed well enough to keep out noise from housekeeping and other guests.

However this time (last week), although still finding the same excellent service, good value, and casual, friendly ambiance as before, alas I have to say that my meal wasn't quite as perfect as before. I ordered the halibut in a lemon wine sauce with rice and requested that it be cooked well-done, but I received halibut cooked medium with some ordinary tartar sauce on the side, and no rice. It was good enough, but not what I had ordered. In retrospect I wish I had gone with what my husband and son ordered--the swordfish kabobs, which were excellent, and prepared as described on the menu! Next was dessert, and I must say the chocolate mousse pie was delectable enough that it somewhat made up for my slight disappointment with the halibut.

Music: The music was awesome.  Admittedly we are a bit obsessive about music, so we provided him with a lengthy list of songs (there was probably enough for double the amount of hours of our reception) and an extensive list of directions/guidance - half of the songs we wanted played in full and for the other half we asked for portions of the songs to be mixed in throughout the night.  Gavin knew exactly when to play full songs and very artistically mixed in portions of songs at the right time.  He kept many our guests on the dance floor all night long.  Gavin definitely has an ability to read the crowd and play the right music at the right time.  In the days and weeks after the wedding, we continued to get compliments from our many of our guests regarding the great music.

Professionalism: All our interactions with Gavin prior to the wedding were very professional and pleasant and he's such a cool guy.  We had a blast working with him.  Gavin also went above and beyond expectations.  For example, our ceremony took place on the beach in front of the Cabrillo Pavilion Arts Center, where our reception was located.  Although Gavin wasn't hired to provide any music or services for the ceremony, he helped us out at the beginning of the ceremony by directing the wedding party members for their entrances.

After researching several venues, we decided that the Riviera Mansion was a great fit for us. The menu looked fantastic, the staff was super accommodating, and Breanna really worked with us and our wedding planner to help design the vision and ""look"" we were going for. We said we wanted everything to be outdoors...no problem. We said we wanted string lighting and chandeliers in the trees...no problem. We wanted to use all the ourdoor lawn for cocktail hour, dinner and dancing, have a live band and a dj, sweetheart table and cake table. If we dreamed it up, Breanna and the staff were all hands on deck to work to accommodate it. 

A few months before the event, we did our tasting for the menu. And the food was OUTSTANDING! Really great portions, delicious flavors and beautiful presentation. And I will say that the food was consistent from tasting to the actual wedding, and our guests RAVED about it. We even had people asking for seconds! Wedding food is never something that typically stands out, but I can say the steak and the fish options we had were absolutely delicious. And again, Breanna and the kitchen were able to accommodate when I requested that the fish needed to be wild and sustainably caught--again no problems.

I would be remiss if I did not mention the Food & Beverage manager, Eli. Eli was such a sweetheart--making sure we thought about everything during the preparation walk through meeting and that we were happy the day of and throughout the event. You can tell he takes great pride and joy in his job and venue.

Breanna, Eli and team were so flawless in organizing everything that we honestly had nothing to worry about--working with this venue was stress free, which made for two very happy brides. The venue is beautiful, the staff is so dedicated and happy, and the service was wonderful.

Cute and simply decorated. Thought the value for money was pretty good. Other reviews mention it is expensive, we found it to be a better deal than most of the other area hotels when we booked online before we came out. Breakfast was a bit boring, pastries and cereal, coffee and juice, but it was exactly as advertised, so no surprise there - you can't really be mad about it! We just grabbed coffee and croissants each morning and then went out and had breakfast on State Street where there are TONS of restaurants. (Try Tupelo Junction Cafe for breakfast!) Front desk people very friendly, helpful and polite. No issues whatsoever during our stay. A quite basic hotel, as other reviews state, but also a lot of character, with all exterior-entry rooms, lots of beautiful plants and a pretty interior courtyard. Our one room suite had a full kitchen, which was great, we used the oven to reheat dinner leftovers and kept yummy smoothies (from ""Backyard Bowls"" on State Street!!) in the fridge. We never had a problem finding parking, but again, we are talking about early April so not exactly busy season. Lots of great restaurants around, we had dinner at Toma and it was fabulous. Great location overall, half a block from the beach. Easy walk to State St, even though other reviews say it isn't...if you can't or don't want to walk a couple of miles, just take the shuttle, it's 50 cents and very easy.

-Large Dance Floor? Check
-People Actually Dancing? Check
-Decent Music? Check
-Decent Looking People? Check
-Minimal Amount of Creepers? Check
-Nice Bartenders? Check (although there is this one girl who is on my shit-list)

Basically if you want to dance and have a good time this is the place to go. Although I'm serious when I say this: they need to play more black music (house/techno/electro has been heard ad-nauseum, we need a healthy mix/balance). Also, I love Wildcats for their music, but DAYUM do they have a disproportionately high creep-a-creepin population who are very persistent. 

Aside from the dancing, I love this place because of the bartenders. Normally I go to my boy Jeremie, who to be honest, I'm not sure if he knows me. Regardless he always treats me right and that's why I'm a fan. He serves me whether I am only ordering water for the night or ordering drinks and he doesn't even give me a lip when I only order water. But all the other bartenders have been really nice to me too, except for this one girl, but we ended up going to another bartender who made it right.

It was that and so much more.  The room was huge, and nicely appointed save for the lack of much in the way of wall decor.  The king bed was incredibly comfortable.  There was a couch in a nook, and a refrigerator and coffee maker.  The bathroom was a tad small, with only adequate counter space and a single sink.  The linens were magnificent.  Bed linens were soft and comfortable; the towels were wonderful.  The bathroom featured a separate faucet which dispensed filtered water - I didn't have to use my Bobble to get good tasting water as I do in most hotels.  The room also had a private patio with dining table and chairs as well as a chaise lounge.  The room was quiet, remarkably clean and looked as if it had been refurbished recently.  Front desk staff was friendly and very accommodating.  We arrived t 1:00 p.m., and knew we were early.  Sure enough, our room had not yet been cleaned, but the desk clerk pulled the staff from another room and reassigned them to our room right away.  In an hour, it was done.  The location is wonderful - just a 1/2 block from the beach and harbor.  It didn't hurt that the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile was parked in the parking lot for two days and the Wienermobile staff was allowing looks inside and giving away Wienermobile whistles.  That was cute.  Overall, this is one of the best hotels we've experienced, and we've been traveling the US for two years, staying in dozens of hotels in every price range.  Excellent room, decent continental breakfast, coffee maker in the room, great linens, an air conditioner that worked well and made just enough noise to provide perfect ""white noise"" for sleeping.

More real business and networking gets done here than all the other coffee shops in town put together. That's because it's NOT on State but rather near the Saturday morning farmer's market, has plenty of free parking, and is spacious--departments in which most coffee shops in town are lacking. 

And the coffee. Geez. They serve Verve, so what else do I need to say? I can't turn down their iced Tres Leches, since my fiancee and I are suckers for sweetened condensed milk in coffee.

Since CA is a wine country, I have decided to bring a local bottle of wine for every place I visit and love.  Santa Barbara Wharf has the most beautiful, old looking,authentic wharf. So that  Thursday afternoon, after visiting the last spot of the day and before driving to the hotel I decided to stop at the fisherman wharf for the sunset  and  finally visit the winery Deep Ocean, The riesling I bought was delicious, the servers were very friendly and eager to serve people. The views on top of the wharf by the balcony where spectacular, it was sunset time of a beautiful summer day. It was paradise. And the best of everything that balcony is pet friendly, so you can bring your best friend with you to see the sunset at the wharf while you chill out, relax and sip wine. Perfect and paradise in earth for a ocean lover girl like me. Of all the wineries in the ""city""  wine trail in Santa Barbara also known as ""funk zone"", this is my favorite spot. And I really mean it,because I have visited all of them for business reasons in the last 2 days. But finishing my day visiting this winery and watching the sunset, will forever stick in my mind and life is about moments and memories. I left the place promising myself to come back the next time, to Santa Barbara, not for business, but for pleasure in the company of my dear husband.  This place is in my must visit list.

Absolutely beautiful and delicious sushi. 1/2 star off for the limited selection and it is a bit pricey. There are no warm items on the menu besides miso soup which was pretty basic. Broth, a cube of tofu and a dash of fresh scallions. The menu is somewhat limited and there are no prices on the rolls. We ordered 3 rolls, the poke, the orange roll (salmon around a salmon roll), and the salmon roll with assorted fish on the outside. Our total was $53 before tip. We just moved from Atlanta, it's a but pricy compared to what we are used to. Not sure how it measures up to sushi in the area since this is our first sushi stop in Santa Barbara. I want to emphasize that the rolls were very generous with the fish (and not too much rice - yey!) and the fish was delicious. I would highly recommend the poke roll.  I'm only bummed about the lack of warm menu items like tempura and takoyaki - things I love to get at Japanese restaurants.  Overall, the sushi was excellent and (maybe) a tad pricey. I'd definitely go there again.

OpCeT5V-KIHnmZ_btJBTGg,5npMFP1mnCcExrWTNTpZxg,UvIDb2FiDCgPuVtDT2rGew,5,1,0,0,"Seriously, this company is as good as it gets when it comes to expertise and finesse in the DJ industry. My wife and I had our wedding a month ago (December 2014) in Solvang, and finding the right DJ had been our highest priority. She believed from the beginning that this could make or break the party, and after seeing how perfectly it went off, I see that it all really did hang in that balance. I admit that I was stuck in pricing from the 90s and didn't plan to spend what we did on this aspect of the wedding, but now I know I'd easily pay much more for the quality we received. (Side note: we skimped on the video people and got what we paid for).

Gavin deejayed the event, but the overall company gave us real peace of mind from our very first phone call. Their online planning tool taught us what events we'd need music for, and they even provided all of the music and equipment for the ceremony. 

On our RSVP form, we had asked our guests, ""What song is guaranteed to make you get up and dance?"" - a question we weren't sure we'd ever get answered, let alone use at the event. However, their responses flowed in, and we sent them along to Gavin. Not only did he use every song - which kept our floor filled all night - but he mixed them so expertly that the beats seemed to match song to song to song in short intervals. The requests from guests weren't even all dance-friendly, but he made them danceable!!! We really had a pro dance party there thanks to him. 

Above all, it must be mentioned that our event was no typical affair for a deejay. I wish I could say we made it easy on him, but at least 5 different people had surprises that Gavin had to keep secret and straight from the next.  This could have led to several miscues and mistakes - but not on Gavin's watch. He nailed every single cue with the perfect song intro or mic placement.  All of this while playing master of ceremony. 

Gavin, Carly, and team, we cannot thank you enough for what you did for us. People are still talking about the wedding almost a whole month later, and everyone wants us to know that we had the greatest DJ.  We are so lucky, and could not be more grateful. 

THANK YOU!!!!",2015-01-06 01:27:12,Gavin Roy Presents,1834 Bath St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4265713,-119.7165402,5.0,78,1,{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True'},"DJs, Party & Event Planning, Wedding Planning, Event Planning & Services","{'Tuesday': '10:0-17:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-17:0', 'Thursday': '10:0-17:0', 'Friday': '10:0-17:0'}",1,seriously company good get come expertise finesse dj industry wife wedding month ago december solvang finding right dj highest priority believed beginning could make break party seeing perfectly went see really hang balance admit stuck pricing plan spend aspect wedding know would easily pay much quality received side note skimped video people got paid gavin deejayed event overall company gave u real peace mind first phone call online planning tool taught u event would need music even provided music equipment ceremony rsvp form asked guest song guaranteed make get dance question sure would ever get answered let alone use event however response flowed sent along gavin use every song kept floor filled night mixed expertly beat seemed match song song song short interval request guest even dancefriendly made danceable really pro dance party thanks must mentioned event typical affair deejay wish could say made easy least different people surprise gavin keep secret straight next could led several miscue mistake gavin watch nailed every single cue perfect song intro mic placement playing master ceremony gavin carly team thank enough u people still talking wedding almost whole month later everyone want u know greatest dj lucky could grateful thank

This was the first time that my partner and I ate here and we did not where to go and what to do. We were like standing inside until we asked a server how we order and he told us that there was a window on the side of the building. If you want to eat inside, you might have to wait for a while but if you want to sit outside, there are benches on both sides of the restaurants. Depending on how busy it is, you might have to share with other people which is great and fine! 

We ordered a cioppino and I imagined that it was going to be a small serving but when we got it, it was huge! It fed me and my partner. We meant to just get a snack because we were going to go to the public market but I ended up getting really full. I did not try anything else so I can't vouch for anything else but this cioppino was AMAZING!

As for parking, you can park on the wharf which I was amazed at because most wharfs or even piers that I have been to are usually only for pedestrian traffic. And parking is free for first 90 minutes (that's what I remember).

Highlights:
- Views: after a short elevator ride, you can walk around the square and see views from each direction. Mountains and the mission on one end and the ocean on the other. Cool birdseye spot to check out the little city. 
- Free: not your typical big city spot where you have to pay $20+ 
- Nice sb style building 
- Just few blocks from action on State Street

Lowlights:
- Not much else there so more of a few minutes activity than a destination

I really wanted him to be with me when I got my first tattoo, so I decided to look up parlors in Santa Barbara. I found this place, and I'm glad I went. 

I was running late. They were really nice and were willing to wait for me and stay past closing to let me get my tattoo. Unfortunately, I don't remember the guy's name, but he was fantastic. I originally wanted the tattoo on my ribs, but was terrified about the pain. He was really thorough in answering all my questions, and told me that the best place for the tattoo I wanted given its size would be on my left shoulder. At that, I was convinced. The process itself was pretty straightforward -- he traced it on my shoulder, asked me if I liked it, and once I approved, he got to work. 

My pain tolerance isn't as high as I thought it was. Thankfully, my friend was there to hold my hand, haha. I'm really, really, really happy with the results and if I'm ever back in Santa Barbara wanting a tattoo, I'd be sure to go to them.

I didn't realize how close it was to Lower State street and a little walk to the beach.

To switch things up, I ordered the Dragon Bowl which had pitaya, mangoes, kiwis, and bananas. The texture of the acai was very different. It had a glue-like texture rather than the classic icy-smoothie style. Besides the texture throwing me off, this was great! The sliced fruit was fresh and the acai wasn't so cold that it gives me a brain freeze! What really surprised me was how big the portion was. If you're not that hungry, I would recommend splitting this with someone or getting the kiddie bowl.

It's so great that the cats are taken in from the local shelter and are adoptable. It makes it that much more enjoyable of an experience. I think the cats would much rather be there than in a shelter setting, given the amount of attention they get and the overall coziness of the place. Also, they will give you a freebie if you come in for your birthday, which I thought was sweet.

Some improvements could be made: 
-More comfy furniture for the humans (maybe some couch chairs to lounge on?). 
-I would be more inclined to choose Cat Therapy as a hangout spot if coffee and treats were actually made and served there, rather than the employees having to go pick up food and drink items from a different cafe to bring back to you.

Fried calamari combo came with fried scallops, fried oysters, fried shrimp and of course fried calamari (we didn't get to try the calamari bc they ran out... they instead gave more of everything else)... It also came with side of onion rings and cole slaw... 

The combo actually isn't big... it's about 2 pieces of each... but I think the price is reasonable... around $13-14...

In the planning phases Breanna did an excellent job of reminding me and keeping me on track for any due dates and fun things like our tasting.

 Speaking of tasting! We had the amazing fortune of having a fully customized wedding menu. I'm not sure my husband and I did a good job of describing what we wanted but, when we showed up for our tasting, it was what we wanted and didn't even know we wanted. I had this vision of a modern and elegant take on some classic Mexican dishes. I wanted a chile relleno with a little pizzaz. Ours had yummy goat cheese white cream sauce with vibrant pomegranate and pumpkin seeds  sprinkled on top. I also wanted romantic and traditional chicken mole. Chef Harley nailed it. He was so concerned with every detail, it warmed my crazy bride soul! I could keep going. 

Now, don't get me started about Eli! A saint. This man knows service. From our first tasting, to our walkthrough, to the day of, it doesn't get any better. They most certainly exceed The Bacara (I've worked there).  Did I mention we made the crazy request for ""Pineapple cider"" and at our tasting they brought at least 10 varieties for us to try! I am beating myself up not remembering some of the other attendants on that day. I recall having a sweet and magical conversation with at least two folks who made sure I couldn't stop smiling that day. They did everything from keeping a fresh coconut cocktail in my hand to ensuring my dad's plate was full and my mom was charmed. 

On the day of, Breanna surprised me with a sweet gift, a MAC lipgloss for touchup. I actually happened to have lost my lipstick I had picked out and this gloss was my savior:)

Intrigued, we went inside to find out more and see what exactly a cat cafe was. The girl who was working there was so welcoming, answering all of our questions happily and excitedly. You could tell she really loved her job. She told us how Cat Therapy was an adoption center for cats who had been rescued from kill shelters. They offered an hour play time with the cats and kittens, as well as organized events such as Happy Meow'r and Cat Yoga. We opted to sign up for Sunday Cat Yoga. The yoga class wasn't challenging, and would be considered more of a basic yoga class, but it was one of the most relaxing and fun yoga classes I've ever taken. The cats are free to roam around, so as we were doing our downward dogs and chatarungas (or should I say CAT-arungas), the kitties would run underneath you, rub against your arms and legs, and sniff at your curiously.

Their bread was crispy and not soggy, their marinated pork was packed with flavors and had a bit of crunch,  it also had beans, cheese, ham and avocado. You must try it with their spicy green  sauce from the salsa bar. Also tried their chicken sope and it was pretty good to our liking.  

At the salsa bar..   We first thought that they mixed up their signs between the medium &  spicy.  Medium was the red sauce &  spicy was the green.  A must try.

Oysters

A little pricey. They have 3 options but I found it to be not worth the money. Brophy Bros can give you more oysters for less and a much fresher taste.


Rock Crab!

THIS IS A MUST. You get a salad a soup combo with it as well. Its 3 lbs of a whopping local rock crab. The flavor was superb. Best $23 dollars I ever spent. I split it with my girlfriend and I was still full.

Overall,
I recommend getting whatever the daily special is. They'll always deliver and you'll save some money too. I heard good things about the beer-boiled shrimp so i'll come back soon to try that out.

Hi brides and grooms to-be, my husband and I got married at the Riviera Mansion on October 9, 2016 and we had the kind of experience that you dream of. We were first drawn to the mansion for it's beautiful location (we live in LA but we wanted to do a mini destination wedding) and the romantic grounds. The price, all of the rooms and spaces that come with the rental, and the historic/Santa Barbara spanish building style inspired us to visit and take a tour. We saw there was a parking lot dedicated for guests (so convenient!), we found out that you get the mansion for the whole day (which was very important to us), and we found out just how many things were included in the rental price (so much I can't even list it!). I did a ton of research, looked at the amazing Yelp reviews, and compared venues/prices, and the Rivera Mansion was by far our #1 choice. Working with Breanna and her team truly felt like a luxury experience. From start to finish, Breanna was there for us every minute. If I ever had any questions or even just wanted to bounce ideas with her, she was always so sweet, patient, and outgoing. Breanna and her team are impeccably organized and responsive (every time I called, she picked up & every time we asked for information I'd get an email within minutes). Not once did I ever feel rushed or hesitant to call or email her. She is AMAZING!! There is so much that goes into planning a wedding, and having a venue and coordinator like the Riviera Mansion and Breanna made the process so fun and stress-free. It was so comforting to be working with such a professional, kind, and giving team. If you're looking for a beautiful location and venue, and you want to work with good people who are the best of the best at what they do, the Riviera Mansion is your venue.

Yesterday my friend and I decided to take advantage of their ""1/2 price rolls"" deal and boy was it good! I had The Philadelphia, The Santa Barbara, Tempura Shrimp and California Rolls and my friends and I also ordered the ""Crispy Rolls"" which weren't on the menu, to split.

Quick Tip: Crispy Rolls. Enough said.

The service at the sushi bar was great and we had a lot of fun talking and taking our time. The food was more than filling and tasted so fresh. One really learns how bod sushi buffets are when you have fresh sushi for the first time in a long while.

The waitress was always on top of things refilling our drinks and splitting the checks for all 5 of us. Another great aspect about this place is it's location. With the reasonably priced (for Santa Barbara) parking lot right behind it we were able to leave our cars and just walk up and down State St. to work the food off.

Just in location alone, at the end of a pier, in beautiful Santa Barbara, a small bar/shack restaurant, it is a fun and romantic set up.

The place is small and everyone is seated counter style along the kitchen and along the windows. There are some tables outside as well. You will get to know your neighbors, so get ready to be cozy. But I found this part of the charm and fun.

The seafood is fantastic. Fresh, simple and just a pleasure. I have been here twice, the first time we shared the 3 lb crab, shared the clam chowder and both had oyster shooters and an extra order of onion rings. The crab was fresh and that platter was worth it. The clam chowder had lots of chunks of clam and a good briny broth. The oyster shooters were delicious. The onion rings were more heavily battered than I liked, but still tasty.

The second time, we got ciopinno and clams strips. The cioppino was served in a large sour dough bowl brimming with a garlicky, spicy broth and chunks of scallops, shrimp, mussels and a side of crab. I LOVED IT. For winter time, this is the dish to get! We also got the clam strips and they were very well prepared. Not too heavily battered and the clams were tender.

Overall, I have several items on the menu and covered the bases among steamed and fried dishes. I will come back and look forward to making the drive to visit this place again.

The food was amazing! After asking what was popular here (Topa topa burger and fish tacos), I ordered the Lama Burger! My friend ordered the MAC and CHEESE, and Parmesan fries. 

Shortly after being seated, our food was brought to the table. First thing I noticed was the nice plating and presentation! The fries came in a tiny metal basket and my burger was oozing with yumminess. 
The mac and cheese was the very perf creamy and cheesy, which I liked. But the BEST thing was the Parmesan fries, which were outta da world! It was slightly brown, crispy, and garlic-y! Mmm my burger was giant and the sauce was soooo good. There was fried tomato in it too. Only downside was that it was challenging to eat without getting it all over me and looking like a monster but that didn't stop me!

My husband liked the ""look"" of the restaurant (not our typical criteria for restaurant selection).  It reminded me of those mahogany and leather high-end restaurants of old... which somehow managed to be very comfortable and inviting.  The decor: large leather banquettes and contemporary chairs, giant mirrors, grape vines sporting tiny, Italian, white lights hanging from the ceiling and an odd collection of ""sculptures"" with fresh roses on each table.  The restaurant was impeccably clean.

But let's talk about the FOOD!  Fresh bread was served with butter and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  While we waited for our entrees', the waiter brought us a tasting of their white beans (fabulous) and cabbage cooked in a spicy tomato sauce (yum).  

My husband ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  Very tasty, very Italian, very plentiful.  The homemade Italian dressing on the salad was to die for.

I ordered their homemade ravioli appetizer (giant ravioli stuffed with cheese and fried to the perfect crispness) and Insalata Caprese (Buffalo Mozzarella with tomato slices and fresh basil drizzled with a wonderful Balsamic Vinegar).  Caprese is my favorite salad, and this one did not disappoint.  

By the way, service was incredibly attentive (even bringing us fresh bread plates when our entrees' arrived).  I wish we were staying longer in Santa Barbara...

First of all, the music! Yes. Good hip-hop that you can actual dance to. And there's no cover, yay! 2 friends and I had to wait in line for about 5 minutes around 11 on a Saturday night, which wasn't too bad. I thought it was pretty small at first but there is a back area and maybe even an upstairs. I don't know, but I do know I liked the vibe in the front area. It's divey but fun. They were playing music videos on the tv's and there was a DJ on an elevated platform in the corner. Our bartender was nice and made good drinks... potent but not unbearably strong. There weren't too many creepers here either. Phew. Drinks were reasonably priced too.

You can always find some really unique kicks here - and the prices don't make you shudder either.  Every time we visit SB we buy multiple pairs of shoes and/or hats here, and every time the employees are so laid back and helpful, the music is awesome, and their stock, while not overwhelming, is completely up-to-date and on trend. If you buy multiple pair of shoes, or are a regular customer, they will kick down a discount for you too - HELLO amazing customer service and salesmanship...just when I thought it was almost extinct.  I do miss the little baby/toddler shoe section they used to have in the back...I used to get my toddler some pretty badass little sneakers that no one else had for their kids - but they were cool about explaining why they didn't carry them anymore.

Overall, I would say the employees and the selection make this place so wonderful.  The employees are young, but really respectful and definitely know their shoe game.

After scouring the dimly lit side streets and the overpriced cafes on state I stumbled upon a good cup of coffee. Delicious red eyes, coffee, an eclectic tea collection, and I don't say this lightly. THE BEST CROISSANT in the 805. 

First a little about moi. I am a noted croissant specialist who has munched on pastries from Paris to Brussels to Omaha and I know a thing or two about France's favorite breakfast. Good cup has manifested a croissant with a brilliantly flaky outer layer which upon the first bite reveals a soft, fresh, delectable middle. Peets coffee and Starbucks obviously lack in their pastry game due to the frozen garbage they parade around as food and the French press provides a croissant with adequate flakiness but just not the same dough. The only place which rivals good cup for its bread quality is d'angelos bakery which has the sb bread game on lock down. 

While it is shameful that there are no coffee shops in this town other than Starbucks open past 10pm on most nights, if you happen to walk past good cup when it is open please head in.

But not here: the building looks like a futuristic gas station (which, had they one of those chalkboards things outside, would likely empower them to make ""fuel"" puns for days). On a nice day (most days here), the sunshine comes pouring in. 

More importantly, their coffee is great. I've been to both Handlebar & the Santa Barbara Roasting Company and I have to say this was my fave. Their cappuccino was not too foamy and instead really layered the milk in top of the espresso shot, providing a cool contrast between the two.

Likely very privaledged people and that are local or college students. Not diverse at all. Most seem to be beach style (trendy but rough like you just got out of bed but your look is premeditated). Comfortable seating area, very busy which is probably great for business. Pretty sure I saw a dude with beach clothes on and a gold chain. Also saw some women in emo style but they appeared to be privaledged as well (obviously not certain of any of this but I want to paint you an accurate picture). 

Food: Pretty good and likely considered healthy (I can never really tell). Lots of Acai and other styles of bowls to include oatmeal and quinoa. I got the quinoa bowl and my wife tried the muesli bowl. The food was pretty good. 

Service: Nothing special. Good service.

Tried the flight of wines (2 whites and 3 reds) and also a beer and a glass of wine.  The flight was a nice balance and ranged from the viognier to the shiraz.  All were reasonable and the ladies behind the bar were very helpful and accommodating, helping us to choose some wines by the glass and also some beers.

Started with a cup of clam chowder. Soup was very good, thick and creamy. (Perhaps more thick than I was expecting, but it was good.)

Seating space was limited. So it was great that my colleague and I had a harbor view, but it was kinda awkward at first overlooking directly on to other diners in the outdoor patio -- but we got over it quick. 

The coffee here is...... amazing!!! Soooooo smooth... it was SOO good we had to ask the server what kind it is. And it turns out it is a local company, Carribbean Coffee. The flavor was Cafe Maestra -- super yum!

nVeacZSq0kDN3vsSgM-KnA,BhFueyWrmPhmmkoPOVriFQ,bjsBMTS4RD7Bs35ugv_fPA,5,0,0,0,"We stayed here for our wedding in Santa Barbara. We are very glad that we chose to stay here. When we visited the inn to see if we would like to stay we immediately fell in love. We booked a couple of queen rooms at a discounted rate for the large number of rooms our family would also be needing.

When we checked in the lady running the front desk asked if we were with the wedding. My SO mentioned we were the bride and groom and she upgraded us on the spot. She let us pick a private suite and our photographers/friends got a less private but possibly grander suite. There were wine glasses in the room (much needed later) and a great whirlpool tub. A nice balcony was on our room (much smaller compared to our friends'), and we were able to park in covered private parking. They brought us a very nice breakfast every morning and the bed was exceptionally comfortable.

There are a few things that needed work in our room, so if I could give a 4.5 star review, I would. The heater/air conditioner was quite a beastly contraption with some rather annoyingly bright LEDs right above the bed; I prefer it very dark to sleep. The window treatments were also insufficient to that end. The chairs next to the table were not the sturdiest feeling, and as a 190lb. guy, I didn't feel confident sitting in them. The door to the hallway where our room was did not lock. This didn't do anything to make us feel secure, but since someone could simply break into the balcony door it really didn't matter much. The security of our room (I cannot speak for the others) simply could have been improved. Also, there were some spotlights on some interesting statues in the room that would turn on and off at intermittent and irregular intervals. I imagine that it was an overheat protection circuit, but it was nonetheless distracting when visiting with friends we had not seen in quite some time.

All in all, we cannot recommend this place enough. We surveyed many hotels in this area of SB before deciding on this one; it was simply the best we could find for a reasonable price. The only reason for listing all of these negatives is hopefully the owner of the hotel will take them into consideration.

We stole him from my friend's wedding last year and I knew as soon as I got engaged that I wanted him at my wedding too. We got married in Los Angeles and he was totally willing to travel 1.5+ hours to have a meeting at the venue a few months prior. The way he mixes songs and transitions to the next one is so good! He's not cheesy at all and plays good, modern music that people like to dance to. People were dancing not only on the dance floor, but also in the lounge area and in the table aisles at the wedding!

I like on Gavin's website you can enter in songs for specific parts of the wedding and also create a general playlist. He also has song recommendations on there. I even asked him to mix and customize a few songs and he did exactly what I wanted. He also MC'd the wedding and was perfect at it - friendly and said enough to keep the wedding going and announce different things but did not take over. 

Throughout the planning process he was very communicative and helpful. We had a couple phone meetings to talk about what we wanted and how he works. The week before the wedding we went over in detail the flow of the wedding and what happens when.

The Shellfish Company sits on the end of the Stern's Warf which is one of the longest deep-water pier between Los Angeles and San Francisco.  From the outside you can see the tanks of fresh Abalone, Dungeness Crab, and the infamous Spider Crab.  You must make a reservation here and be prepared to wait a bit.  The inside is a classic, you are here for the food not the ambiance,  tavern style seafood bar with outside seating (be careful it can get windy). My sister and I sat at the bar.  The bar and overall inside seating is pretty tightly compacted which may bother some.   We, however, were in seafood heaven and talked it up with the staff/bartenders who were really awesome; enjoying life kinda people - they tipped it to the official 5 star review. 

We started with the Abalone for an appetizer which was really good; perfectly seasoned and cooked. I also had to try the chowder - awesome, but Maine's is better!   They have a decent array of beers on tap and I chose a local brew.  For dinner we split the Spider Crab cause we ain't scared of shh... ok, maybe I was a little....it was huge!!!  The dinner combo, I believe, came with choice of soup or salad.  Splitting the crab was definitely enough for two people. I recall my sister throwing in the towel and me testing my manhood.

I was recently in Santa Barbara for a stop during a road trip, and I decided to quench my endless desire for acai bowls at Backyard Bowls. As a die-hard acai bowl lover, I was so happy to find this awesome spot!

I ordered the Cocoa Almond Bowl (honestly tasted better than most chocolate ice cream), and my sister ordered the Green Bowl (kale, spinach, acai, ginger goodness--get this if you like ginger!). Both were absolutely amazing! Definitely a bit on the pricey side, but we ate them for lunch and one bowl was more than enough to fill up one person. I recommend coming here with a friend and splitting a bowl!

We had to wait 20 minutes or so for one of the few (4) tables outside, but we ordered our food as soon as we were sat, and it was served to us less than 10 minutes later.

We enjoyed the crabs, laughed, told a few life stories and watched a beautiful sunset from the edge of the pier. We watched as sailboats continued to slip past us on into the early evening, and after enjoying a perfectly warm (74°-76°) January afternoon, the server turned on the overhead heaters to fend off an evening chill.

I most recently got to try a bunch of Boulder beers here - it's so interesting to see what other areas have to offer!

They've also gone a step further than other spots in the ""Funk Zone"" and teamed up with local bakeries and restaurants to offer food flights that compliment their wine and beer offerings. I love that small business teamwork, guys! And it says a lot that they put in the extra effort to expand their clientele and bring a new dynamic to their tasting room. Keep up those delicious burgers and cupcakes!

Last but not least, I have to gush about the staff and the overall ambiance that they've helped create in this cozy little spot.

At first we got lost and went around the restaurant. But it was literally right next to Casa Blanca! Just keep walking up passing Casa Blanca and you will see it. I believe it's street parking only or if you want to pay for parking at the lots. There was plenty of street parking on a Tuesday. 

When you first walk in, its order first, then you go grab a seat inside the restaurant or outside their patio. A hip place playing some awesome music. The prices are average and don't complain about it because it tastes so fresh! The food is really good!

We were looking at pictures of yelp of what other yelpers got and decided on the built your own hash. It was so bomb!!! We got sweet potatoes with sage sausage, spinach, tomatoes, mushroom and cheddar cheese. I like my eggs a little runny so I chose over easy eggs with the hollandaise sauce on top. It was so flavorful in every bite! The egg yolk mixed in with the sausage and vegetables and that oooey gooey cheese! BOMB! Comes with a side of salad and choice of toast. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!

We decided to order a salty and sweet. So this dish was like a dessert plate. We choose French Toast. Small portion that comes with 3 slices. The other option was 5 slices I believe. But this was enough to share between the 2 of us without being over stuffed. Comes with fruits which were pretty sweet and not sour. They didn't have much variety of sweet dishes. It was either french toast or pancakes.

It's so peaceful and quiet and never kids running around. It's a little on the funky side, but good funky. Nothing is new, but it's clean. The location is great!  Just a block from the beach. They serve the best coffee, and their free breakfast is really a perk. But communication is missing. We weren't aware of ""bikes,"" being available, or cookies, that I'm *now* reading on this site. When asked for a local market, we were sent to what I can only say is a Mexican market. Another issue, is parking. We came home late one night and found their lot full. They didn't let us know that this might be an issue or tell us where to park in case it happened. A few other  things, like the shower curtain was ancient, old, and the hooks falling apart in my hand (really)--I gave the front desk one of the broken hooks, but it wasn't replaced, so we had this ""sag,"" where a missing hook went.  Also, no place to put your toiletries and it's a juggling act, unless you rearrange their towels, cups and baskets, which really needs to be rethought on their part. Our bed this time was hard and uncomfortable, and needs a modern pillow top. We had issues with their electrical set up, too. You have to use your room card to activate power, but the switches were confusing, and there is no outlets near the bed (who doesn't use a lap top in bed?). We had air conditioning, so not sure why other reviewers didn't.They had an old microwave and coffee pot in the room (I think these could go), iron, ironing board, extra pillows and blankets, a safe (perk), wi-fi with decent connection, lots of drawers, TV, lots and lots of pillows (perk).  Ok, ok, I gave some negatives, but I still like this place. They have the BEST coffee! If you like homey places, with a bed and breakfast feel, quiet, clean, no frills, no kids running around, this is perfect. I'll be back here, for sure.

The only thing I'd complain about is that the wait for the sushi bar is really long. You can't sit at the Teppan Yaki tables if you're only getting sushi and the sushi bar seats only a couple of people.

My husband and I met in Santa Barbara so it was only fitting that we got married in a place that reminded us of where it all began. One of the things I loved about the venue is it's rich history in Santa Barbara and how beautifully the architecture and gardens photograph. The staff at the Riviera Mansion are top notch and really created a premium experience for us, from the first email we sent to Breanna to the walk-through, the tasting, rehearsal and the wedding day itself! We felt so well taken care of throughout the night- they checked in on my husband and I and our parents throughout the night to ensure we had our favorite drink in hand, got to taste all of the appetizers by putting a special plate at our dinner table and kept our champagne topped off for all of the toasts. One of the big selling points for us was that the venue included a lot of the basics like catering, bar, dinner rentals, bride & groom suites, and different ceremony and reception sites. I was grateful to be able to get ready, take photos, have a light lunch before the wedding all onsite. The venue itself is BEAUTIFUL and so dreamy.

I love the attention my hair received today. Shannon was my hair stylist and did an incredible job. I love her perfectionist attention to detail from when I described what type of haircut, bangs, and style I wanted to the finished style. I only get a haircut once or twice a year so, I want it to count.  I highly recommend Shannon if you specifically know what you want done with your hair. She exceeded all of my expectations and it was a wonderful experience. ;-) 

I docked a star because the front desk was more worried about making appointments than keeping them. Granted I was running approx. 10 min. late to begin with, but it was another 10 - 15 min. before the front desk even acknowledged my presence and tried to find me in the computer. They had my name spelled wrong in the appointment book so, it took a while further to confirm which appointment was mine. 

Working in the service industry myself: I understand how important it is to have good front desk help and understand that sometimes there are bad days and good days as a front desk helper; however, appointment's names should always be spelled out and confirmed when the appointments are made in addition to letting the person know who their stylist is to avoid any mix-up please.

I also further tried to make appointments for a group of 10 and the front desk clerk refused to make appointments for my group without knowledge of all services of each person. I finally called the salon for a fourth time on a day when luckily, the front desk girl was sick and one of the hair stylist was able to make my appointments with no problems and without all the names of the people and knowledge of services. I am still confused to why the front desk was trying to turn away so much business... and I am so happy all my appointments were made thanks to stylist Angela and Shannon.",2010-10-10 08:49:14,19 Blue Salon,19 W Ortega St,Santa Barbara,CA,93101,34.4179736,-119.6984966,4.5,108,1,"{'BusinessAcceptsCreditCards': 'True', 'RestaurantsPriceRange2': '2', 'BikeParking': 'True', 'ByAppointmentOnly': 'True', 'BusinessParking': ""{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"", 'GoodForKids': 'True'}","Beauty & Spas, Hair Salons","{'Tuesday': '10:0-19:0', 'Wednesday': '10:0-19:0', 'Thursday': '10:0-19:0', 'Friday': '10:0-19:0', 'Saturday': '10:0-19:0'}",1,http bluenet love attention hair received today shannon hair stylist incredible job love perfectionist attention detail described type haircut bang style wanted finished style get haircut twice year want count highly recommend shannon specifically know want done hair exceeded expectation wonderful experience docked star front desk worried making appointment keeping granted running approx min late begin another min front desk even acknowledged presence tried find computer name spelled wrong appointment book took confirm appointment mine working service industry understand important good front desk help understand sometimes bad day good day front desk helper however appointment name always spelled confirmed appointment made addition letting person know stylist avoid mixup please also tried make appointment group front desk clerk refused make appointment group without knowledge service person finally called salon fourth time day luckily front desk girl sick one hair stylist able make appointment problem without name people knowledge service still confused front desk trying turn away much business happy appointment made thanks stylist angela shannon

Location
Allows dogs ($15/night fee)
