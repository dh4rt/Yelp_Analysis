I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.</td>\n",

Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.   \n",

Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.   \n",

       "3  We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.   \n",

The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.</td>\n",

       "3  We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.   \n",

       "      <td>We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.</td>\n",

Our waitress brought our separate sushi orders on one plate so we couldn't really tell who's was who's and forgot several items on an order. I understand making mistakes but the restaraunt was really quiet so we were kind of surprised. Usually hibachi is a fun lively experience and our  cook  said maybe three words, but he cooked very well his name was Francisco. Service was fishy, food was pretty good, and im hoping it was just an off night here. But for the money I wouldn't go back.   \n",

Grab a bite, grab some tastings, life is good. Right next door to the Santa Barbara Wine Collective, in fact it actually shares the same tables.  We had a fabulous savory croissant.   \n",

       "3  We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.   \n",

       "      <td>We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.</td>\n",

       "3  We were a bit weary about trying the Shellfish Company on the Wharf as more often than not, many places like these (see Cannery Row, Monterey) feast on a captive audience and provide sub-standard fare at high prices.\\n\\nHowever, emboldened by the perennial good reviews on Yelp, we suppressed our initial observations and went ahead with the trying it out. The place is small, so definitely plan ahead. You will have to wait, so either you know, just do so, or perhaps try to visit outside of peak hours. Luckily, our wait was only about 20 minutes as the dinner rush was just leveling off.\\n\\nThe special was the local rock crab - $25 for 3 lbs of California Rock Crab, salad, and your choice of soup/chowder. After taking a look at a few trays of rock crab being served out, the wife and I both opted for it, as it looked awesome.  \\n\\nThe salad/chowder combo was great as you actually received hearty portions of each, so it was a good start. As much as I liked the chowder however, the Shrimp Bisque the wife ordered was amazing, so I would recommend that going forward. \\n\\nBut enough of prattling on about side dishes: the rock crab tasted just as glorious as it looked. Juicy, buttery chunks of white crab meat await you, just a few cracks away. While the rock crab shells are pretty thick, once cracked, they splinter and separate easily, a good sign they are cooked to perfection. The rock crabs provided a great amount of meat for what I felt to be the least amount of work you're going to do for crab, King or otherwise. \\n\\nWe were thoroughly satisfied with our meal and along with the special being an overall great value, devouring the Rock Crab at SBSC turned out to be one of the favorite meals on the trip. I think ordering crab here is a safe proposition indeed.   \n",

The spiral staircase is funny. One can get view of entire city from 5th level. The tower clock room is really surprising with all mechanical gears inside!! You need a prior appointment to get into clock room. Worth spending 2 to 3 hours of time here.   \n",

I originally thought it would be faster than taking my own picture, cropping and printing it, but I gave up on FedEx and went and did it myself.

The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.</td>\n",

There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.</td>\n",

I wish this approximated it.\\n\\nOur order consisted of fairly pedantic fare, as far as Indian goes:\\n\\n-pappadam...not on menu they went to the Nepalese place across the street to buy it...chutney. ...noooope\\n- chicken tikka (date ordered it , don't judge) tasted like tomato soup with tandoori chix\\n- chicken jalfreizi, ordered Indian spicy, had canned veggies in it, in a broth - like substance, unedible\\n- Naan- was ABC and dry, oh and burnt-to-beat-the-band.\\n- garlic kulcha- only edible item.

Went in for a passport photo, and there were two guys working there. In ten minutes of standing at the counter, neither of them ever acknowledged that I existed, or even looked my way. As I waited, a line of customers waiting to pay formed behind me. I originally thought it would be faster than taking my own picture, cropping and printing it, but I gave up on FedEx and went and did it myself. Don't know who else does passport photos, but for copies, I certainly choose to use the local Bill's Copy Shop, after a previous bad experience with FedEx for copies. They're a waste of time.   \n",

       "4     The staff of this H&M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. \\n\\nFriday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.   \n",

No way, and the Paradise Cafe proves my point. Great little breakfast place in downtown SB with a little dish I just couldn't pass up, the Huevos Venezuela. It's basically a fancy way of saying 'breakfast burrito' with eggs, black beans, peppers, cheese and salsa on the side served with potatoes. Easily the best way I've ever had eggs prepared.   \n",

I must say we were very pleased with our choice to stay here. This quaint quiet beautiful lovely place was just what we needed to enhance our relaxing vacay. Our little love nest was white glove clean lol. There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.   \n",

It came with your choice of soup (we chose chowder- YUM!) and the Caesar salad.\\n\\n We sat al fresco, you were your name on the clipboard outside. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated around noon. Come early if you don't want to wait because they just tell your name when your table is ready. Great service and food!   \n",

The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.</td>\n",

This quaint quiet beautiful lovely place was just what we needed to enhance our relaxing vacay. Our little love nest was white glove clean lol. There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.</td>\n",

I wish this approximated it.\\n\\nOur order consisted of fairly pedantic fare, as far as Indian goes:\\n\\n-pappadam...not on menu they went to the Nepalese place across the street to buy it...chutney. ...noooope\\n- chicken tikka (date ordered it , don't judge) tasted like tomato soup with tandoori chix\\n- chicken jalfreizi, ordered Indian spicy, had canned veggies in it, in a broth - like substance, unedible\\n- Naan- was ABC and dry, oh and burnt-to-beat-the-band.\\n- garlic kulcha- only edible item. Tho it was neither garlic or kulcha\\n\\nAll for the low, low price of 70 cold stones. \\n\\nIf you like a bizzaro world of Sysco \"Indian food\" this your place.

Went in for a passport photo, and there were two guys working there. In ten minutes of standing at the counter, neither of them ever acknowledged that I existed, or even looked my way. As I waited, a line of customers waiting to pay formed behind me. I originally thought it would be faster than taking my own picture, cropping and printing it, but I gave up on FedEx and went and did it myself. Don't know who else does passport photos, but for copies, I certainly choose to use the local Bill's Copy Shop, after a previous bad experience with FedEx for copies. They're a waste of time.   \n",

       "4     The staff of this H&M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. \\n\\nFriday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.   \n",

No way, and the Paradise Cafe proves my point. Great little breakfast place in downtown SB with a little dish I just couldn't pass up, the Huevos Venezuela. It's basically a fancy way of saying 'breakfast burrito' with eggs, black beans, peppers, cheese and salsa on the side served with potatoes. Easily the best way I've ever had eggs prepared.   \n",

I must say we were very pleased with our choice to stay here. This quaint quiet beautiful lovely place was just what we needed to enhance our relaxing vacay. Our little love nest was white glove clean lol. There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.   \n",

It came with your choice of soup (we chose chowder- YUM!) and the Caesar salad.\\n\\n We sat al fresco, you were your name on the clipboard outside. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated around noon. Come early if you don't want to wait because they just tell your name when your table is ready. Great service and food!   \n",

I wish this approximated it.\\n\\nOur order consisted of fairly pedantic fare, as far as Indian goes:\\n\\n-pappadam...not on menu they went to the Nepalese place across the street to buy it...chutney. ...noooope\\n- chicken tikka (date ordered it , don't judge) tasted like tomato soup with tandoori chix\\n- chicken jalfreizi, ordered Indian spicy, had canned veggies in it, in a broth - like substance, unedible\\n- Naan- was ABC and dry, oh and burnt-to-beat-the-band.\\n- garlic kulcha- only edible item. Tho it was neither garlic or kulcha\\n\\nAll for the low, low price of 70 cold stones. \\n\\nIf you like a bizzaro world of Sysco \"Indian food\" this your place. If u want anything close to Indian.....wide berth from your local India garden.   \n",

Went in for a passport photo, and there were two guys working there. In ten minutes of standing at the counter, neither of them ever acknowledged that I existed, or even looked my way. As I waited, a line of customers waiting to pay formed behind me. I originally thought it would be faster than taking my own picture, cropping and printing it, but I gave up on FedEx and went and did it myself. Don't know who else does passport photos, but for copies, I certainly choose to use the local Bill's Copy Shop, after a previous bad experience with FedEx for copies. They're a waste of time.   \n",

       " 4     The staff of this H&M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. \\n\\nFriday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.   \n",

No way, and the Paradise Cafe proves my point. Great little breakfast place in downtown SB with a little dish I just couldn't pass up, the Huevos Venezuela. It's basically a fancy way of saying 'breakfast burrito' with eggs, black beans, peppers, cheese and salsa on the side served with potatoes. Easily the best way I've ever had eggs prepared.   \n",

I must say we were very pleased with our choice to stay here. This quaint quiet beautiful lovely place was just what we needed to enhance our relaxing vacay. Our little love nest was white glove clean lol. There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.   \n",

It came with your choice of soup (we chose chowder- YUM!) and the Caesar salad.\\n\\n We sat al fresco, you were your name on the clipboard outside. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated around noon. Come early if you don't want to wait because they just tell your name when your table is ready. Great service and food!   \n",

The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.</td>\n",

This quaint quiet beautiful lovely place was just what we needed to enhance our relaxing vacay. Our little love nest was white glove clean lol. There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.</td>\n",

Tho it was neither garlic or kulcha\\n\\nAll for the low, low price of 70 cold stones. \\n\\nIf you like a bizzaro world of Sysco \"Indian food\" this your place.

Went in for a passport photo, and there were two guys working there. In ten minutes of standing at the counter, neither of them ever acknowledged that I existed, or even looked my way. As I waited, a line of customers waiting to pay formed behind me. I originally thought it would be faster than taking my own picture, cropping and printing it, but I gave up on FedEx and went and did it myself. Don't know who else does passport photos, but for copies, I certainly choose to use the local Bill's Copy Shop, after a previous bad experience with FedEx for copies. They're a waste of time.   \n",

       "4     The staff of this H&M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. \\n\\nFriday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.   \n",

No way, and the Paradise Cafe proves my point. Great little breakfast place in downtown SB with a little dish I just couldn't pass up, the Huevos Venezuela. It's basically a fancy way of saying 'breakfast burrito' with eggs, black beans, peppers, cheese and salsa on the side served with potatoes. Easily the best way I've ever had eggs prepared.   \n",

I must say we were very pleased with our choice to stay here. This quaint quiet beautiful lovely place was just what we needed to enhance our relaxing vacay. Our little love nest was white glove clean lol. There was complimentary wine and cheese and  breakfast cereal and bagel etc orange juice. The staff was very friendly. Check in was a cinch. Parking was readily available. My only hiccup was the t.v. was really small and all the way at the other end of the room made it a little hard to see, but we didnt come to watch much television. We had a lot of fun things planned but we never got around to doing them because we were soo comfortable from the atmosphere of this Inn. I loved it. The big bed was comfy with a quilt to match. Pillows very soft and huge. My hubby and I will definitely return to stay here again. If you are looking for relaxation this is the place. The ocean is right across the street. Nice view.   \n",

It came with your choice of soup (we chose chowder- YUM!) and the Caesar salad.\\n\\n We sat al fresco, you were your name on the clipboard outside. We waited about 10 minutes before being seated around noon. Come early if you don't want to wait because they just tell your name when your table is ready. Great service and food!   \n",

I'm actually hesitant to fill out this Yelp review for selfish reasons because I want to keep this secluded, delicious little culinary escape for myself! Although if it closed that would be heart breaking so here it goes... The food was fresh and magnificently beautiful. Our whole table ordered the 7 pate tasting menu and left the plate decisions up to the chef. We were politely delivered flavorful fish dishes that I had never had in all different forms-as well as sushi. I can't remember the names of all the fish and dishes, we were all having such a great time yapping about all the different flavors - who's got time to take notes? In short, the restaurant  was inviting, the staff cared for our needs, the food was delivered promptly, it was visually beautiful, and quite satisfying in regards to taste. I WILL go back again, perhaps after all these 5 star reviews I'll have to make a resi though.</td>\n",

Tips are appreciated, but not required. You don't have to dance if you don't want to, the music is just as entertaining. The service was also very good, we got our drinks in an appropriate amount of time. The drinks were very delicious. Get there before 8, it's highly recommended!!

However, we were able to have my in laws watch them which allowed for us to have some time to ourselves. We were able to book the room the night before for a room with a queen bed for $149 (not including taxes). This is a very cute space and I loved that it was super cute with the Spanish style decor. They have covered parking that is first come first serve, otherwise you have to look for street parking. The location is only a block from the beach and about 0.5 miles from downtown Santa Barbara which is great for walking! They also have a daily \"social\" hour from 5 to 7 pm where they have wine, cheese, grapes, and crackers. In the morning, they provide breakfast which includes cereal, croissants, bagels, yogurt, and fruit. The rooms are on the smaller side and the bathroom is tiny as well, but it does the trick for a place that you can stay in and lounge around in. They have a beautiful courtyard that can also be enjoyed if you so wish. Checking in/checking out was very simple. The room keys were actual keys. Overall, I liked the experience and we have already suggested this place to our friends and family and we are sure to be back and stay here whenever we are visiting.</td>\n",

I'm actually hesitant to fill out this Yelp review for selfish reasons because I want to keep this secluded, delicious little culinary escape for myself! Although if it closed that would be heart breaking so here it goes... The food was fresh and magnificently beautiful. Our whole table ordered the 7 pate tasting menu and left the plate decisions up to the chef. We were politely delivered flavorful fish dishes that I had never had in all different forms-as well as sushi. I can't remember the names of all the fish and dishes, we were all having such a great time yapping about all the different flavors - who's got time to take notes? In short, the restaurant  was inviting, the staff cared for our needs, the food was delivered promptly, it was visually beautiful, and quite satisfying in regards to taste. I WILL go back again, perhaps after all these 5 star reviews I'll have to make a resi though.   \n",

Not just for breakfast either.  It is healthy and while the downtown location is sometimes difficult to park by, the La Cumbre location is WICKEDLY easy and fast.\\n\\nThe bowls are delicious - I always get the island bowl and coffee with cashew milk - delicious.\\n\\nThe employees are great.  Brought in my best guy and he adored it - even over his choice room service at the 4 seasons!  Yum!   \n",

Both pianist were very talented. They sang/played music from 70s 80s 90s and today, they also take requests (great singing voices fyi). My favorite though was Billy Joel songs. Both entertainers had the crowd going and dancing. Tips are appreciated, but not required. You don't have to dance if you don't want to, the music is just as entertaining. The service was also very good, we got our drinks in an appropriate amount of time. The drinks were very delicious. Get there before 8, it's highly recommended!! You'll have a better chance in getting a seat. We'll be back next time.   \n",
       "328  We booked this place thinking we would be bringing our dog along with us (yes, they are dog friendly). However, we were able to have my in laws watch them which allowed for us to have some time to ourselves. We were able to book the room the night before for a room with a queen bed for $149 (not including taxes). This is a very cute space and I loved that it was super cute with the Spanish style decor. They have covered parking that is first come first serve, otherwise you have to look for street parking. The location is only a block from the beach and about 0.5 miles from downtown Santa Barbara which is great for walking! They also have a daily \"social\" hour from 5 to 7 pm where they have wine, cheese, grapes, and crackers. In the morning, they provide breakfast which includes cereal, croissants, bagels, yogurt, and fruit. The rooms are on the smaller side and the bathroom is tiny as well, but it does the trick for a place that you can stay in and lounge around in. They have a beautiful courtyard that can also be enjoyed if you so wish. Checking in/checking out was very simple. The room keys were actual keys. Overall, I liked the experience and we have already suggested this place to our friends and family and we are sure to be back and stay here whenever we are visiting.   \n",

The food isn't spectacular but it tastes good. Portion size is excellent. They play movies on a flat screen as well. Open air is nice but i found a mosquito near me. Overall a good experience !  I had kungpao chicken.   \n",

       "      <td>The staff of this H&amp;M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. \\n\\nFriday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.</td>\n",

Went in for a passport photo, and there were two guys working there. In ten minutes of standing at the counter, neither of them ever acknowledged that I existed, or even looked my way. As I waited, a line of customers waiting to pay formed behind me. I originally thought it would be faster than taking my own picture, cropping and printing it, but I gave up on FedEx and went and did it myself. Don't know who else does passport photos, but for copies, I certainly choose to use the local Bill's Copy Shop, after a previous bad experience with FedEx for copies. They're a waste of time.   \n",

       "4  The staff of this H&M are some of the WORST retail employees I have ever encountered. \\n\\nFriday Sept 11 my friend and I came in to find a dress for my upcoming presentation. The young man running the dressing room was very sarcastic and rude to customers yelling \"you're welcome\" in an obviously exaggerated and disingenuous manner. When we finally found what we came for, the power went out. We were asked to drop our items and exit the store. We asked if there was any way we could hold our items. The staff member said she would put them on hold under our name. \\n\\nSaturday Sept 12 we returned right when the store opened, and the staff was very unhelpful and made very little effort to try to find our items we thought were on hold. We looked around on the racks for our desired items and they were nowhere to be found. We asked several employees for help and they could not be bothered to care other than to point us in the direction of where it \"should be\". When I was in the fitting room, my friend finished before me and returned her number to the employee. As she walked away, the fitting room staff who we had asked about our items proceeded to talk about how annoying she was and that helping us is \"not their job\". I get it, you are a retail employee and it's late Saturday morning, but we were not rude, we simply asked if you saw the dress, if you could possibly help us find what we are looking for. If you can't be bothered to help customers than you shouldn't be working in customer service. Talking crap about customers on the job (especially when they can hear you) is never acceptable. Good luck in the real world ladies, I hope your catty, \"not my job\" attitudes take you far!\\n\\nAlso, the fitting room floors are absolutely filthy. I had brand new pink socks on and by standing on their floor the bottoms became black from the dirt and dust.   \n",
